If we look at the existing 7 licences in PeerTube, they correspond to the following list:

1. CC-BY: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
2. CC-BY-SA: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
3. CC-BY-ND: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/
4. CC-BY-NC: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
5. CC-BY-NC-SA: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/
6. CC-BY-NC-ND: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/
7. CC0: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

The CC0 licence refers to the so-called 'Public Domain Dedication', which is a tool to enable authors and copyright owners who want to dedicate their works to the worldwide public domain.

In the currently used licences list for PeerTube sometimes this nuance (dedication) gets lost in translation depending on the chosen interface language (like in French for instance, 'Domaine Public'). By leaving out the 'dedication' part, it's not clearly distinct from the 'Public Domain Mark', which is used for works that are free of known copyright around the world. These will typically be very old works.

To make this distinction possible in PeerTube we are introducing an 8th licence for 'Public Domain Mark', which will be part of Creative Commons plugin for PeerTube.

Public Domain Mark: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/
