As the CC Platform Toolkit advises to give users clear choices about how they would like their work to be used under Creative Commons. To make sure the platformâ€™s user flow supports the user, we looked for a simple way to let users pick and learn more about licences.

As Creative Commons already provides a way to [choose a licence](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) and they are working on a new and more cleaner interface ([beta version](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/ )) and PeerTube already utilises links to external sources in their help icons content, we made the following pull request to see if it could land upstream and become part of the main codebase as an improvement for the licence chooser with the default licences.

The pull request was approved after slightly changing the text in the help popup and became part of PeerTube when v3 was released.

EDIT: recently we made another tiny pull request to rename "license" (US English) to the more consistently used "licence" (UK English).
