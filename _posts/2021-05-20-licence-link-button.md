Apart from changing the names/labels of the CC licences to their more recognizable international standardized short form identifiers, we have also added a link to the licence deed page, which is required to be accepted as a formally licensed work.

Although we considered just putting the link on the textual representation in the existing metadata list below the description (Privacy, Category, **Licence**, Language, Tags, Duration), this element already has an existing onclick action, namely it is used to act as a filter for a search query on PeerTube.

We decided to use the well-known [CC licence buttons](https://licensebuttons.net/) and added this with a link next to the date & views info below the title, just fitting for the smallest viewport as in a mobile phone web browser.
