# Extending PeerTube

This project aims to extend [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) to support the availability, accessibility, and discoverability of large-scale public media collections on the next generation internet.

Although PeerTube is technically capable to support the distribution of large public media collections, the platform currently lacks practical examples and extensive documentation to achieve this in a timely and cost-efficient way. This project will function as a proof-of-concept that will showcase several compelling improvements to the PeerTube software by:

1. developing and demonstrating the means needed for this end by migrating a large corpus of open video content
2. implementing trustworthy open licensing metadata standards for video publication through PeerTube
3. emphasizing the importance of accompanying subtitle files by recommending ways to generate them
