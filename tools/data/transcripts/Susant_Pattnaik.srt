1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:08,03
Speaker 1: Where did it start for you when you are now 24, 25, 24? So where did it start?

2
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:15,06
Speaker 2: I was starting in my fifth standard. At my age you can say around eight or nine, something.

3
00:00:15,06 --> 00:00:24,72
My father used to give to me some of the remote control control toy cars. Unlike other kids, I like to play with it.

4
00:00:24,72 --> 00:00:32,21
I like to play and try to enjoy it and get happiness through it. But personal this haunts me that why?

5
00:00:32,21 --> 00:00:39,37
Why it is working like this? I always keep asking myself, why? Where? What? Where? When?

6
00:00:39,37 --> 00:00:40,91
I keep on asking such questions that keeps

7
00:00:40,91 --> 00:00:44,64
Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] in my mind.

8
00:00:44,64 --> 00:00:46,69
So because I had been taught in my first standard

9
00:00:46,69 --> 00:00:48,38
or second standard in my early childhood days that current flows from battery to the model through a wire

10
00:00:48,38 --> 00:00:54,07
and through a switch. If you activate the switch the current flows from the battery to the model.

11
00:00:58,98 --> 00:01:04,55
But here the [INAUDIBLE] remote control car, there's a remote there's a car. There's no wires only antennas.

12
00:01:04,55 --> 00:01:08,88
How the current is flowing? So that was really curious for me.

13
00:01:08,88 --> 00:01:19,66
And in the beginning I got shocked, that why it is happening?.

14
00:01:12,64 --> 00:01:19,55
It might be some ghost might have entered inside the car because I used to watch like ghost movies [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:01:19,77 --> 00:01:21,96
That's why it is working in that way.

16
00:01:24,11 --> 00:01:30,56
And after two days or three days, I tried to explore that how this ghost exactly looks like. So I thought that.

17
00:01:31,04 --> 00:01:38,8
And I know that to hack any smaller maybe [INAUDIBLE] gadgets, one small instrument is required and that is a tester.

18
00:01:39,04 --> 00:01:45,00
Small screwdriver, I just got somewhere,and just untighten the screws. Open the box, and said wow.

19
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:48,63
That was a really interesting thing for me which really attracted me

20
00:01:48,63 --> 00:01:52,78
and created a passion towards me towards technology and gadgets.

21
00:01:53,53 --> 00:01:58,78
So I just saw, I just explored, I just pulled out the circuit, and I just saw and wow.

22
00:01:59,38 --> 00:02:13,86
That is something which I was expecting. So I just, after my expectations for I'm glad, I'm satisfied that, yes.

23
00:02:13,86 --> 00:02:17,7
And then finally I tried to place it back, put back the cover of the car, I just tightened the screw.

24
00:02:17,7 --> 00:02:19,14
And I tried to switch on the remote.

25
00:02:19,46 --> 00:02:27,13
So yeah, one day I was in my home, and my parents were out for the shopping and

26
00:02:27,13 --> 00:02:30,55
when I was 11 my mind kept exploring kept wondering what next to do.

27
00:02:30,88 --> 00:02:40,16
Other kids in other activity but I was noticed in hacking gadgets and on, that was my passion from my childhood.

28
00:02:40,39 --> 00:02:46,00
So I saw now what to hack, one to have. My father stopped giving me and he kind of such toys, but now what to hack?

29
00:02:46,37 --> 00:02:50,58
So one television, one TV, and that television fascinated me,

30
00:02:50,67 --> 00:02:57,11
that was what that would be because in the small toy car there was electric circuit.

31
00:02:57,42 --> 00:03:08,38
So how big that electric circuit would be, in that box type TV.

32
00:03:08,38 --> 00:03:15,69
And those days we don't do have LCD type TVs because at least a couple of, 10 to 15 years back,.

33
00:03:10,13 --> 00:03:21,9
we used to have that big box type TV and it has a [INAUDIBLE] That that we used to have those days.

34
00:03:22,24 --> 00:03:28,61
So I assumed it was that. I know just to hack those gadgets, one small instrument is required and that is tester.

35
00:03:28,61 --> 00:03:35,16
I just got it from somewhere and again I untightened the screw. When I just opened the box I said wow.

36
00:03:35,16 --> 00:03:41,5
That was really for me. I like I just. Exclaimed that, wow.

37
00:03:41,84 --> 00:03:46,76
This is something general, I got like something a treasury, this is a treasure for me.

38
00:03:46,76 --> 00:03:56,54
Then I just, I just, like, I'm collecting all the golds and diamonds, but it wasn't really gold and diamonds for me.

39
00:03:56,54 --> 00:04:02,2
I am all the circuits and I'm just pulling all the circuits and wires and everything and [INAUDIBLE] I got a shock.

40
00:04:02,44 --> 00:04:05,13
I just checked that the power was off [INAUDIBLE]

41
00:04:05,13 --> 00:04:14,43
realized because I don't during that time I didn't have any electronics knowledge.

42
00:04:14,43 --> 00:04:21,84
[INAUDIBLE] So [INAUDIBLE] that was a capacitor which holds.

43
00:04:21,84 --> 00:04:25,5
And [INAUDIBLE] subtracting [INAUDIBLE] experience, I mean [INAUDIBLE] knowledge.

44
00:04:25,5 --> 00:04:32,2
So, I'm wondering, I just got completely lost in that circuit.

45
00:04:32,39 --> 00:04:38,73
I'm just completely excited, I was completely passionate towards that one [INAUDIBLE] and everything.

46
00:04:38,73 --> 00:04:43,68
I was completely involved in that. Then the start of I heard a beep sound.

47
00:04:43,68 --> 00:04:49,92
I just stopped what I was doing just peeped through the window and I saw my parents came.

48
00:04:49,92 --> 00:04:56,19
Without wasting a single time I just packed all the circuits and all the wires as fast as possible.

49
00:04:56,43 --> 00:05:04,79
I just put back the box, back in the screw, jump to the bed holding the book upside down. [SOUND] And parents came in.

50
00:05:06,93 --> 00:05:12,14
Then my father. Something is not common. Something I notice my kid has done.

51
00:05:12,14 --> 00:05:17,99
I just see that he's holding the book upside down. Something notorious activity he has done.

52
00:05:18,05 --> 00:05:19,78
Let's see what he has done. So my father, just forgetting everything, just asked for the dinner.

53
00:05:19,78 --> 00:05:25,02
Cuz that was around late night, around 10 PM you can say. So my mom dinner later on, first the.

54
00:05:25,02 --> 00:05:26,46
Because Indians are more into daily soaps and on.

55
00:05:26,46 --> 00:05:40,6
Indian normally more into daily soaps and also my mom can skip dinner, can't skip that's what in their sasbo reels,

56
00:05:43,14 --> 00:05:49,12
that daily soap serials. So first that, so my mom just relaxed on her bed.

57
00:05:49,12 --> 00:06:04,61
Power on the plug of the TV, put the remote [INAUDIBLE] press the power button.

58
00:06:04,61 --> 00:06:06,7
[SOUND] One corner of my house was on fire. All my neighbors, all my relatives, they're bringing the sand and water.

59
00:06:06,7 --> 00:06:14,28
I was like yes I did it. I am the scientist yes I did it. I just screamed like anything, yes I did it.

60
00:06:14,28 --> 00:06:15,19
I'm the scientist.

61
00:06:15,19 --> 00:06:22,45
Because that time I had the knowledge that the person who does something or pressing something it blasted.

62
00:06:22,45 --> 00:06:24,8
Then you've got a scientist.

63
00:06:24,96 --> 00:06:30,37
I knew that was the meaning of a scientist when I was a kid so I was screaming like anything.

64
00:06:30,51 --> 00:06:35,77
And then all my parents, all my relatives, all the neighbors they came to me.

65
00:06:35,77 --> 00:06:36,92
I thought they were coming to applaud me what I have done.

66
00:06:37,07 --> 00:06:45,33
But that applaud was in such a way that my stomach was completely filled with all the scoldings, all the screamings,

67
00:06:45,33 --> 00:06:49,71
whatever they can do. So my dinner was completely done that day.

68
00:06:50,33 --> 00:06:56,37
And from that day onwards, I was kept away from all the circuits, all the gadgets.

69
00:06:56,86 --> 00:07:11,31
Everything even after a few days even if you come to my neighbors, any of the neighboring house and say [INAUDIBLE]

70
00:07:11,31 --> 00:07:18,69
is coming to your home. And they'll first keep aside the gadgets [INAUDIBLE] something's coming. Hacking of the gadget.

71
00:07:18,69 --> 00:07:24,45
So away from him. So that was when I was [INAUDIBLE] passion towards technology and all.

72
00:07:25,3 --> 00:07:32,44
But gradually my passion towards innovation happen by an accident you can say.

73
00:07:32,44 --> 00:07:33,83
Because I never thought that I should make an innovation.

74
00:07:33,89 --> 00:07:44,93
I was fascinated and I was passionate towards technology, gadgets and all. But then when the innovation is an accident.,

75
00:07:40,84 --> 00:07:44,93
And that happens in the, with that.,

76
00:07:43,99 --> 00:07:51,02
When I was in my [INAUDIBLE] when I was 16 years old, I had gone to the hospital with my father.

77
00:07:51,02 --> 00:07:55,8
I mean my father generally used to have high blood pressure and he goes for a weekly check-up.

78
00:07:55,91 --> 00:08:01,15
So one day I accompanied him to the hospital and the clinic you can say, not a hospital.

79
00:08:01,15 --> 00:08:12,62
It's more [INAUDIBLE] type of clinic and my father just entered inside the [INAUDIBLE] and I waited outside..

80
00:08:08,35 --> 00:08:20,9
So after those few minutes I saw that my eyes [INAUDIBLE] Because of the old age his hands

81
00:08:20,9 --> 00:08:23,06
and movements were restricted and paralysis might have happened for that.

82
00:08:23,23 --> 00:08:30,96
So I was seeing that he was sitting on a wheelchair and then he was being assisted by a nurse all the time from here,

83
00:08:30,96 --> 00:08:34,19
there. So I was just observing what was happening.

84
00:08:34,69 --> 00:08:45,43
And I just found that the person was not able to speak because later I came to know that 70% of disabled people lose

85
00:08:45,43 --> 00:08:48,17
their vocal power because of that paralysis, spinal injury, a little spinal inactiveness.

86
00:08:48,72 --> 00:09:04,24
I mean this [INAUDIBLE] happen so I saw that he was not able to express what he exactly wants..

87
00:08:55,04 --> 00:09:04,86
He was slightly able to raise his hands but not able to express [INAUDIBLE] So he was slightly with his hand

88
00:09:04,86 --> 00:09:15,8
or he might be require water or something. So I handed him a glass of water and he just threw it down.

89
00:09:15,89 --> 00:09:18,82
He want something else. So seeing that really hurts me. I just put myself in that position.

90
00:09:18,82 --> 00:09:24,76
That if someone's brain was working everything working but due to body inactiveness.

91
00:09:24,76 --> 00:09:50,36
[INAUDIBLE] are not able to speak to express. How painful that situation is..

92
00:09:38,58 --> 00:09:52,89
[INAUDIBLE] If I am at least able to improve that life even 1% I will feel more [INAUDIBLE] I was happy

93
00:09:52,89 --> 00:10:00,76
and I was satisfied. At least empower one person. I brought impact in their life.

94
00:10:00,76 --> 00:10:01,78
I just empower the life even one person, I'll be more than happy.

95
00:10:01,78 --> 00:10:10,92
So I just came back to my home and keep on thinking that what kind of so that they can do everything like normal humans.

96
00:10:13,52 --> 00:10:16,61
I just kept thinking and thinking and thinking.

97
00:10:16,61 --> 00:10:24,2
And I finally come to the conclusion that to do something I should figure out what's the common thing to do in a normal

98
00:10:24,2 --> 00:10:36,49
human and a disabled person. I found that brain is common. Only to thinking to other things is not that user friendly.

99
00:10:36,57 --> 00:10:49,51
Everything has a point to the person who will be using that invention..

100
00:10:40,14 --> 00:10:48,56
[INAUDIBLE] multiple things is very difficult because what we think exactly we don't act.

101
00:10:49,51 --> 00:11:02,51
I want to move my hand in this way. Think to move the hand in this way and I command my hand to move in this way.

102
00:11:02,61 --> 00:11:12,68
[INAUDIBLE] So that is the control.

103
00:11:12,68 --> 00:11:13,53
So next interesting thing that I found which is common and which is not parallelized.

104
00:11:13,6 --> 00:11:14,69
Which is common that is breathing. [INAUDIBLE] becomes uncommon like paralysis in a normal human.

105
00:11:14,69 --> 00:11:16,01
All the breathing is not [INAUDIBLE] which is common and which is [INAUDIBLE] properly.

106
00:11:16,11 --> 00:11:20,4
With a normal human and a disabled person. And [INAUDIBLE] control normal breathing.

107
00:11:20,4 --> 00:11:20,82
[INAUDIBLE] Model or technology concern. It's small gadget which converts breathing [INAUDIBLE] to magnetic impulse.

108
00:11:20,82 --> 00:11:44,84
Speaker 2: And it designed in such a way that this acts as a single switch to multiple switch options.

109
00:11:44,84 --> 00:11:53,73
Again we also [INAUDIBLE] of [INAUDIBLE] scrolling. That the future to make forward, left, right movement..

110
00:11:52,86 --> 00:11:56,18
Or to operate electrical appliances. Or to text message..

111
00:11:53,73 --> 00:12:07,03
Which option the person wants to activate [NOISE] [INAUDIBLE] It will just wait for two seconds [INAUDIBLE] to change,

112
00:12:07,03 --> 00:12:09,87
which stops only once [NOISE] activate. Again [SOUND] option will deactivate and again option will keep on scrolling.

113
00:12:11,88 --> 00:12:15,28
So I tried to make that in a simplified way.

114
00:12:15,28 --> 00:12:17,66
You notice it's not something to make something complicated circuit or something complicated.

115
00:12:17,66 --> 00:12:23,65
It's all about how simply we're able to solve that problem. The incumbent problem.

116
00:12:23,65 --> 00:12:28,58
So a simplified solution is always a great innovation, what I feel.

117
00:12:28,58 --> 00:12:35,16
So in this way, in this version of enabler,

118
00:12:35,16 --> 00:12:42,37
happened that the disabled person with a physically assistive device for the disabled person to empower them to do many

119
00:12:42,37 --> 00:12:43,81
activities like humans do. Like navigating a wheelchair.

120
00:12:43,81 --> 00:12:48,93
Like operating all the electrical appliances, texting messages in a specially designed cell phone,

121
00:12:48,93 --> 00:12:51,5
and so many other activities.

122
00:12:51,5 --> 00:12:55,5
Speaker 1: And that was your first invention?

123
00:12:55,5 --> 00:12:56,5
Speaker 2: Yeah.

124
00:12:56,5 --> 00:12:58,17
Speaker 1: There it started.

125
00:12:58,17 --> 00:12:59,17
Speaker 2: Yeah.

126
00:12:59,17 --> 00:13:00,83
Speaker 1: What came after?

127
00:13:00,83 --> 00:13:05,93
Speaker 2: After making this I got my second President of India [INAUDIBLE] for this invention.

128
00:13:08,47 --> 00:13:19,43
And from the [INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE] not everything happened all of a sudden after [INAUDIBLE] magazines, news,

129
00:13:19,62 --> 00:13:27,14
and I was [INAUDIBLE] getting that glory for each and every one. I was like what happened all of a sudden?

130
00:13:27,14 --> 00:13:30,01
I was leading a normal life and how this happened all of a sudden.

131
00:13:30,23 --> 00:13:37,1
But in that glory and then one thing I realized that, this is not for which I'm the universal.

132
00:13:37,1 --> 00:13:41,95
That I realized when I was doing pilot testing on one of the disabled person.

133
00:13:42,63 --> 00:13:51,62
When the disabled person was doing the pilot testing of a device. He just I just how would I had instructed to do.

134
00:13:51,99 --> 00:13:58,41
I just gave a five minute training. And he just [INAUDIBLE] wheelchair forward then right and stopped.

135
00:13:58,41 --> 00:14:05,82
Then he changed options and activated the bulb. I saw the tears falling from his eyes.

136
00:14:05,82 --> 00:14:07,15
Speaker 1: It worked.

137
00:14:07,15 --> 00:14:18,26
Speaker 2: And I realized that that was not tears of sorrow, that was tears of joy.

138
00:14:18,36 --> 00:14:22,15
Looking I started also my, so my eyes also tears came open. I feel that's the real success which I am achieving.

139
00:14:22,15 --> 00:14:22,55
This is the real success.

140
00:14:22,55 --> 00:14:29,32
Finally the you know what's being used by the target person for which for whom I have developed that innovation.

141
00:14:29,32 --> 00:14:38,09
So if I'm able to empower one disabled person life then my purpose of making [INAUDIBLE] is fulfilled.

142
00:14:39,79 --> 00:14:44,23
If I can empower one person then I can empower millions [INAUDIBLE] then yeah then [INAUDIBLE]

143
00:14:44,46 --> 00:14:52,79
we can I mean push this product to the market either we can license to any company.

144
00:14:52,79 --> 00:14:54,46
[INAUDIBLE] we realize that [INAUDIBLE]

145
00:14:54,46 --> 00:15:02,81
medical device so it's better that we should license this invention to any [INAUDIBLE]

146
00:15:02,81 --> 00:15:07,63
that can properly manufacture it at that finished product label.

147
00:15:07,83 --> 00:15:13,78
They can manufacture in that label, so that a disabled person can get the maximum benefit out of it.

148
00:15:13,78 --> 00:15:20,15
So thought it's better that we should license to any metacompany. And we are in position to do that.

149
00:15:20,15 --> 00:15:24,77
Because do commerce like this in because it is going to empower millions of disabled people's life.

150
00:15:24,79 --> 00:15:29,28
So it's better we're already established in this biotechnology

151
00:15:29,28 --> 00:15:37,06
and types of medical technology industries are in this field.

152
00:15:37,06 --> 00:15:43,88
Because at [INAUDIBLE] great level I thought that these people can make it global public and to in that level,

153
00:15:43,88 --> 00:15:51,34
with that financing, with that I mentioned with that vision they can just make it reach to that global level.

154
00:15:52,02 --> 00:15:58,78
And second because as of now we are focusing on some other innovation. On variable.

155
00:15:58,78 --> 00:16:06,88
And also it's better not to focus on multiple areas, just to focus on one area where we can give our best.

156
00:16:06,88 --> 00:16:16,31
So I thought there are many, many people who can their best in this area. Big industries for that.

157
00:16:16,31 --> 00:16:20,41
So in this way we are thinking to get a global impact.

158
00:16:20,41 --> 00:16:24,2
Speaker 1: That's quite a thing for a 24 year old.

159
00:16:24,2 --> 00:16:29,37
Speaker 2: Well yeah, what I thought when I was 16 years old. [LAUGH] Yeah.

160
00:16:29,37 --> 00:16:33,84
Speaker 1: And why do you think it's so unique what you are doing?

161
00:16:33,84 --> 00:16:45,62
Speaker 2: See because I didn't [INAUDIBLE] find exact of the preferred solution to solve that [INAUDIBLE] programs.

162
00:16:46,28 --> 00:16:51,3
For everything there is a solution but there is not a simplified solution.

163
00:16:51,3 --> 00:16:57,48
[INAUDIBLE] we have that streaks [INAUDIBLE] or the joystick wheelchair. That's inventions that are there.

164
00:16:57,48 --> 00:17:01,64
But I feel that whether it is exactly serving the problem.

165
00:17:01,98 --> 00:17:13,02
None of them can serve 100% problem but how much [INAUDIBLE] and probability. Of solving the problem that matters.

166
00:17:13,39 --> 00:17:17,38
And how much percent of the problem is being solved that matters.

167
00:17:17,94 --> 00:17:22,02
If there's an innovation which solves 80% of the problem, if I making a [INAUDIBLE]

168
00:17:22,02 --> 00:17:23,85
90% of the problem then that in [INAUDIBLE] should have it.

169
00:17:25,83 --> 00:17:34,66
And when [INAUDIBLE] gives us something internet and all Many other ways, like, I said, we do this macro-survey.

170
00:17:34,66 --> 00:17:39,73
Whether it [INAUDIBLE] is there or not, or any particular solution is there or not.

171
00:17:40,25 --> 00:17:43,85
If I find that there is no such particular solution, or a great solution,

172
00:17:43,85 --> 00:17:47,38
or the perfect solution for any of the encountered problem,

173
00:17:47,38 --> 00:17:53,00
then I feel that I We know something had to be done either by evaluation to the existing universals

174
00:17:53,00 --> 00:17:54,52
or to create a new universal if it is not there.

175
00:17:54,52 --> 00:18:01,42
Speaker 1: So did you feel aware of those that you are now going to produce?

176
00:18:03,3 --> 00:18:09,44
Is this solution for an Indian and it's for that reason that it works?

177
00:18:09,44 --> 00:18:12,1
Speaker 2: Or is it Yeah, it's started first because of looking into Indian problem.

178
00:18:12,1 --> 00:18:15,89
But finally, I found that it's not only an Indian disability problem.

179
00:18:16,08 --> 00:18:26,5
If you say, global record that US is in the number one percent and can [INAUDIBLE] number of everyday and every year.

180
00:18:26,6 --> 00:18:29,32
Second comes Brazil and third comes India.

181
00:18:29,41 --> 00:18:36,55
But in the increasing number of everyday as for the current scenario then India comes number one.

182
00:18:36,55 --> 00:18:42,25
I don't know what happens in two or three of the [INAUDIBLE] is [INAUDIBLE]

183
00:18:42,25 --> 00:18:47,66
and there is no partner in solution of [INAUDIBLE] just put the [INAUDIBLE] on that.

184
00:18:49,05 --> 00:18:54,02
The cops, police, everyone is working at a great level but the thing is that somewhere, something is missing.

185
00:18:55,14 --> 00:18:58,62
Although there are some solutions like taser guns, pepper spray.

186
00:18:58,62 --> 00:19:05,41
But that's not going to because then I would try to understand the psychology of human way.

187
00:19:05,88 --> 00:19:11,23
I mean people are not using the existing universes of products which is there in the market One thing that is dropping

188
00:19:11,23 --> 00:19:16,29
them to use that is a style shipment in there. Not that, those are not fashionable.

189
00:19:16,29 --> 00:19:22,84
Like if there were people spend the thing then why the people express that way? Why who is going to write them?

190
00:19:22,96 --> 00:19:25,57
And it happens all additionally energy system.

191
00:19:26,41 --> 00:19:34,37
So Psychology creates a problem that that confidence [INAUDIBLE] nothing is going to happen.

192
00:19:34,37 --> 00:19:36,6
You just take the example of helmet.

193
00:19:36,77 --> 00:19:43,94
[INAUDIBLE] but to save them from getting [INAUDIBLE] then that's why they are wearing helmets..

194
00:19:41,54 --> 00:19:48,07
We are not [INAUDIBLE] No one things for the worst.

195
00:19:48,07 --> 00:20:07,6
Which is going to happen, so they are just highly confident that nothing's going to happen

196
00:20:07,6 --> 00:20:20,00
and that's where they don't use people's [INAUDIBLE] or whatever the possible [INAUDIBLE]

197
00:20:20,00 --> 00:20:25,1
have been done to the [INAUDIBLE] and second [INAUDIBLE] any kind of [INAUDIBLE] not fashionable..

198
00:20:20,7 --> 00:20:22,23
And [INAUDIBLE] that those are not variable.

199
00:20:25,1 --> 00:20:30,42
[INAUDIBLE] can be used against us. And then can [INAUDIBLE] Same for the [INAUDIBLE] and any other gadgets.

200
00:20:30,42 --> 00:20:42,87
So last we found that cannot be snatched. But snatching more difficult.

201
00:20:42,87 --> 00:20:44,78
I understand that it can be snatched but it will be difficult than to snatch something which you hold,

202
00:20:44,97 --> 00:20:52,4
which is not wearable. Wearable things [INAUDIBLE] difficult to snatch.?

203
00:20:49,36 --> 00:20:55,65
Now we thought that what have we done with [INAUDIBLE] It will be difficult to snatch as well.

204
00:20:55,65 --> 00:21:01,02
Because obviously we have to compare between a man and a woman man is more physically strong.

205
00:21:03,03 --> 00:21:08,31
And confidence wise [INAUDIBLE] but we have to empower the women or girls.

206
00:21:08,62 --> 00:21:12,24
By giving some value in the problem gadget or something.

207
00:21:12,69 --> 00:21:20,52
So we thought that let's improve on small [INAUDIBLE] which one or two second [INAUDIBLE]

208
00:21:20,52 --> 00:21:26,82
200 degrees celsius which is quite enough to burn someone's hand if someone tries to grab the gadget.

209
00:21:26,82 --> 00:21:29,89
Or grab Any part of the hand or somewhere.

210
00:21:30,4 --> 00:21:36,19
The gull can at least make that gadget contact with any part of the screen and get a severe pain.

211
00:21:36,19 --> 00:21:42,39
It will change the mood or mindset of the attacker.

212
00:21:42,39 --> 00:21:45,76
It will get a fear and panic in the attacker that he should not further attack. That should be used at the last moment.

213
00:21:46,25 --> 00:21:48,12
Before that, we have included a panic button.

214
00:21:48,12 --> 00:21:51,01
Just press panic button, like a siren will get activated which is around 180-200 decibel sound,

215
00:21:56,18 --> 00:21:58,72
which is equal to the ambulance and the police siren.

216
00:21:58,72 --> 00:22:07,00
It can be kept in the lady's purse and it will create a havoc in the environment and it will create a hear in the

217
00:22:07,00 --> 00:22:08,34
Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] attacker.

218
00:22:10,13 --> 00:22:20,66
And at the same time [INAUDIBLE] will go to the registered numbers and [INAUDIBLE] will go and [INAUDIBLE].

219
00:22:19,52 --> 00:22:23,66
nearest [INAUDIBLE] And in this way this [INAUDIBLE] assessment is [INAUDIBLE]

220
00:22:23,66 --> 00:22:37,1
But we know that only just using this protein [INAUDIBLE] wearable is not going to track the [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

221
00:22:37,1 --> 00:22:40,23
customers or the [INAUDIBLE] title [INAUDIBLE] for whom this gadgets we are developing.

222
00:22:41,28 --> 00:22:48,29
For woman, for girls, fashion is a statement, so, in overall we designed it as a smart safety,

223
00:22:48,29 --> 00:23:05,15
smart safety fitness watch. Yes. And finally we included the fitness features and all like the form of a digital watch.

224
00:23:05,15 --> 00:23:17,27
A digital watch that incorporates all the personal features and a hidden [INAUDIBLE] features..

225
00:23:11,94 --> 00:23:17,12
So people will wear as a style statement [INAUDIBLE] if any kind of [INAUDIBLE]

226
00:23:17,27 --> 00:23:20,93
So we are pushing this product in that way in the global market.

227
00:23:20,93 --> 00:23:21,25
Speaker 1: It's like you found almost a niche in the market.

228
00:23:21,25 --> 00:23:24,62
You found a corner in the market that hasn't been covered by others.

229
00:23:24,62 --> 00:23:32,43
Speaker 2: Yes. That's it.

230
00:23:32,43 --> 00:23:32,46
Speaker 1: Has it not been?

231
00:23:32,46 --> 00:23:33,03
Speaker 2: There are fitness was, some better and better and fitness was in the globe.

232
00:23:33,03 --> 00:23:40,4
There are many features, but all in the one available is not available. See, everything is there.

233
00:23:40,4 --> 00:23:49,24
They're like When you make food, you have vegetables and all. But this you make is innovative.

234
00:23:49,24 --> 00:23:54,42
So how you collect the specialty vegetables and all, and how we make it food, that matters.

235
00:23:54,42 --> 00:24:02,75
Finally, how you use the and the sauce, people. Spices and all.

236
00:24:03,46 --> 00:24:09,39
That matters how wonderful and how great you make the food. Because every [INAUDIBLE] everywhere.

237
00:24:09,56 --> 00:24:19,08
So same in case of this gadgets and all. So I will part it into individual features.

238
00:24:19,08 --> 00:24:21,42
Those features will be available everywhere.

239
00:24:25,26 --> 00:24:30,27
But how inadvertently you design how it will consume low power, how effectively it will work,

240
00:24:30,27 --> 00:24:39,09
how much it is user friendly. That matters so this is the one we look we innovate to make it a user friendly solution.

241
00:24:39,42 --> 00:24:53,71
How I mean the target customer like the women and girls can properly use this gadget.

242
00:24:53,71 --> 00:25:01,09
So it's kind of smooth all in one. [INAUDIBLE] design fitness watch with certain features all in one.

243
00:25:01,09 --> 00:25:01,89
Variable is I didn't find anywhere. That's why we developed this gadget.

244
00:25:01,89 --> 00:25:03,3
Speaker 1: And where did you get your knowledge from?

245
00:25:03,3 --> 00:25:12,66
Speaker 2: It's all about [INAUDIBLE] and I am [INAUDIBLE] the work.

246
00:25:12,66 --> 00:25:22,93
I found a problem, and then I tried to identify a proper solution to this.

247
00:25:22,93 --> 00:25:29,76
[INAUDIBLE] I saw that as a problem, this is the encountered problem.

248
00:25:29,76 --> 00:25:33,5
And to this innovation, I accredited it to this innovation. This problem is going to solve.

249
00:25:33,7 --> 00:25:49,6
This is just an idea a raw concept, a raw idea. This is going to put a solution to the problem..

250
00:25:41,36 --> 00:25:42,8
Then we do a market survey.

251
00:25:49,6 --> 00:25:56,05
Solve the [INAUDIBLE] but we found that there are not such great variables

252
00:25:56,05 --> 00:25:59,22
or not such great gadgets which can actually solve the problem.

253
00:26:00,09 --> 00:26:07,43
Then we thought that we have to finally [INAUDIBLE] something. Now I cannot do each and every thing.

254
00:26:08,02 --> 00:26:12,4
It's obvious because I have knowledge in innovation and all, but I have the knowledge and technology as well.

255
00:26:12,4 --> 00:26:16,56
But by doing everything all on our own is very, very difficult. So I develop a prototype.

256
00:26:16,9 --> 00:26:25,05
But to make it a product, that takes teamwork. So now I generalize the work.

257
00:26:25,05 --> 00:26:36,49
But one thing in me that I know, I have a knowledge of which work has to be done at which place.

258
00:26:36,49 --> 00:26:38,51
Who are the right people, who are the people who can do it effectively. What they have that available currently.

259
00:26:38,68 --> 00:27:10,6
I have that knowledge. Due to my experience or due to my exposure of the world. Maybe that [INAUDIBLE] But due to this..

260
00:26:49,08 --> 00:27:10,43
Speaker 1: [INAUDIBLE] It's on again [LAUGH] You should show them. Find a solution for [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]

261
00:27:10,6 --> 00:27:12,11
Speaker 2: Yeah..

262
00:27:11,1 --> 00:27:11,94
Speaker 3: Finding the people [LAUGH]

263
00:27:12,11 --> 00:27:21,97
Speaker 2: Yeah so yeah so yeah I was in that so finally. I told her who are the right people, we're very available.

264
00:27:21,97 --> 00:27:26,88
Who will be able to do a particular thing effectively. Like someone will be doing a great design.

265
00:27:26,9 --> 00:27:33,03
So I found it, tried to create a team, all the great designers, innovative designers, who can attest to a.

266
00:27:33,51 --> 00:27:39,22
So I found to create a team. To create talented and like-minded team around the globe.

267
00:27:39,22 --> 00:27:46,68
Then I keep on challenging the things. Which part goes with who can do in a better way?

268
00:27:46,68 --> 00:27:51,7
Then I try to combine everything to form, including my ideas and innovation

269
00:27:51,7 --> 00:27:52,95
and whatever I can implement if I have done this.

270
00:27:53,07 --> 00:28:01,09
And everyone would do this [INAUDIBLE] and combine to make it one product. So that finally it can create impact.

271
00:28:01,09 --> 00:28:11,3
Speaker 1: And that's what you're saying is that you have a lot of ideas, a lot of inventions you make?

272
00:28:11,3 --> 00:28:16,38
You take one out and commercialize it. But when you look at the other inventions what kind of ideas?

273
00:28:16,52 --> 00:28:19,66
Started when you were 16 a part of the wheelchair.

274
00:28:19,66 --> 00:28:29,33
Speaker 2: That time I realized that to push everything [INAUDIBLE] any of the big companies like Apple,

275
00:28:29,33 --> 00:28:34,34
like Microsoft. You see they came to market with one product. Find the one product that can become a hit.

276
00:28:34,34 --> 00:28:45,06
Success and then it came with other products. Even with that one product they keep updating that one product..

277
00:28:40,75 --> 00:28:45,76
[INAUDIBLE] Apple or Microsoft or [INAUDIBLE] They have one product.

278
00:28:45,76 --> 00:28:50,92
They're focusing to the one product and those are successful focus to the one product.

279
00:28:50,92 --> 00:28:54,48
And they're the one who's creating millions and millions of impact.

280
00:28:55,21 --> 00:29:01,89
So I was particular that if I want to try to impact at the global level I should focus to the one product.

281
00:29:02,23 --> 00:29:13,02
If that is [INAUDIBLE] then I should go to the other product. I would like to go with my [INAUDIBLE] licensing.

282
00:29:13,02 --> 00:29:22,62
To any of the company I can license the innovations, and [INAUDIBLE] I'll do.

283
00:29:23,00 --> 00:29:24,47
It will license by any of the [INAUDIBLE]

284
00:29:24,47 --> 00:29:32,05
organizations that we can add some in every unit we can add some value to that product and they can.

285
00:29:32,27 --> 00:29:34,19
Or they will also add value to the product

286
00:29:34,19 --> 00:29:39,8
and we can jointly we can do the commercialization in the joint collaboration for the commercialization

287
00:29:39,8 --> 00:29:44,58
or by licensing completely to the third-party organization.

288
00:29:44,58 --> 00:29:49,46
In this way other innovations can get into the market and that would create impact.

289
00:29:49,82 --> 00:29:53,06
I would think that each and every innovation from my organization

290
00:29:53,06 --> 00:29:59,56
or from my company I'm going to push is very difficult. And that is everything will not get disturbed.

291
00:29:59,56 --> 00:30:03,94
Speaker 1: I understand that, but that's lots of people have these ideas.

292
00:30:04,32 --> 00:30:06,93
Why is it that you were awarded so many awards.

293
00:30:06,93 --> 00:30:13,14
Speaker 2: The way I visualize and imagine a particular program and I found a effective solution for that.

294
00:30:13,14 --> 00:30:26,41
It's all about how effectively the innovation is going to solve the problem, and how simplified the innovation is.

295
00:30:26,74 --> 00:30:41,45
How innovative the idea is. If you take everything into consideration that's where it's been by the president of India..

296
00:30:31,85 --> 00:30:46,11
[INAUDIBLE] What have I got so far? So that [INAUDIBLE] matters..

297
00:30:41,45 --> 00:30:46,78
I could have done in a more manner. It's all about [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

298
00:30:46,78 --> 00:30:49,11
Speaker 1: That's why you were awarded.

299
00:30:49,11 --> 00:30:51,78
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could say that.

300
00:30:51,78 --> 00:30:56,29
Speaker 1: And do you agree with that? That you were awarded?

301
00:30:56,29 --> 00:31:02,3
Speaker 2: Yeah, because first thing, on the big night I was thinking that there are many more great innovators,

302
00:31:02,3 --> 00:31:08,87
there are many more innovations, gadgets which are far complicated than my innovations. But why I got awarded?

303
00:31:08,87 --> 00:31:22,91
And obviously the people who give the award out, that win a lot of talented jury members and all would have sit

304
00:31:22,91 --> 00:31:24,62
and thought that whom they should [INAUDIBLE] choose me.

305
00:31:25,00 --> 00:31:25,66
And obviously they represent something that [INAUDIBLE] my innovations.

306
00:31:25,66 --> 00:31:26,11
Something greatness they have found in that innovation.

307
00:31:26,17 --> 00:31:35,24
Then [INAUDIBLE] from them are from somewhere I came to know that, it's [INAUDIBLE].

308
00:31:30,24 --> 00:31:33,57
because how simply program has been solved.

309
00:31:36,43 --> 00:31:44,17
And those innovations these are the innovations that can revolutionize the current scenario.

310
00:31:45,38 --> 00:31:48,64
And it's not about always a complicated opposite, all levels just simplifying.

311
00:31:48,64 --> 00:31:56,78
Speaker 1: And can you tell me, explain a bit more of the innovations you were awarded for.

312
00:31:56,78 --> 00:32:04,85
You have the wheelchair, you have the watch. Other innovations or inventions you?

313
00:32:04,85 --> 00:32:09,56
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well we have also designed a low-cost electricity system like a [INAUDIBLE] with a great efficiency.

314
00:32:09,56 --> 00:32:21,47
[INAUDIBLE] so yeah but what we have [INAUDIBLE] only if you [INAUDIBLE] has to be done.

315
00:32:21,56 --> 00:32:24,88
[INAUDIBLE] and you can get around 12 to 15 hours electricity.

316
00:32:24,88 --> 00:32:36,2
So that innovativeness we did is that talent we have work on by making that innovation. That's a action which we did.

317
00:32:36,2 --> 00:32:42,66
So for such kind of a gadget now there are many better gadgets like during those days since five to six or several.

318
00:32:43,48 --> 00:32:50,5
We did a gadget where we can open all the computer and laptop applications without using a keyboard and mouse.

319
00:32:50,5 --> 00:32:53,63
The keyboard and mouse we transfer to a gadget.

320
00:32:54,01 --> 00:33:01,72
Just like we just act everything in the air and that will get resulted on the computer screen.

321
00:33:01,72 --> 00:33:12,06
Like I would click here, that would get clicked. I will like I can type here. Everything I can do so.

322
00:33:12,06 --> 00:33:15,87
[INAUDIBLE] great revolutionary invention but now there are a lot many since came.

323
00:33:16,39 --> 00:33:26,42
So in this way there a lot of innovations [INAUDIBLE] because we know that driverless cars are [INAUDIBLE] cost

324
00:33:26,67 --> 00:33:32,4
and design it's one. If people want some more designs of the car or something they cannot get a driverless.

325
00:33:32,62 --> 00:33:34,11
To get a driverless car they have to buy that particular car.

326
00:33:34,11 --> 00:33:47,44
And it is difficult that the vision is to reduce road accidents. Its vision is to reduce traffic jams and all.

327
00:33:47,44 --> 00:33:53,05
So, each and every vehicle has to be driverless. If not, only one who can get it's not possible.

328
00:33:53,33 --> 00:33:55,24
Everyone can afford a driverless car.

329
00:33:55,24 --> 00:34:03,63
Everyone cannot that all together will not sell their old car to get the driverless car.

330
00:34:03,91 --> 00:34:06,61
So you have to think for each and every one.

331
00:34:06,61 --> 00:34:15,51
So like I told her, keep committees then, which can be implemented each and every vehicle, even a low-cost vehicle,

332
00:34:15,51 --> 00:34:17,82
even someone is using a low-cost vehicle.

333
00:34:19,47 --> 00:34:21,51
And the kit can implement from a low-cost vehicle to a vehicle who vehicle that is more than millions.

334
00:34:22,04 --> 00:34:23,8
And those vehicles were converted to a driverless.

335
00:34:23,8 --> 00:34:27,69
Ensure making a driverless car minor to make a driverless kit and instruct, make it a driverless one.

336
00:34:27,69 --> 00:34:36,82
So that is where the global story, the mobility industries.

337
00:34:36,82 --> 00:34:37,22
Speaker 1: And that's and what's your role in that?

338
00:34:37,22 --> 00:34:37,83
Speaker 2: Yeah we have designed the kit.

339
00:34:37,83 --> 00:34:45,34
So we are looking that we can license to any team automobile industry so that they can get into the market.

340
00:34:45,34 --> 00:34:46,44
We don't want to commercialize this innovation.

341
00:34:46,44 --> 00:34:53,78
Speaker 1: And what makes it Indian what you're doing? It's so specific that.

342
00:34:53,78 --> 00:35:05,37
Speaker 2: Yeah because see in India traffic jams and [INAUDIBLE] is more as compared to the other developed countries.

343
00:35:05,37 --> 00:35:09,03
Because here the traffic management is gradually getting proper but [INAUDIBLE]

344
00:35:09,03 --> 00:35:14,77
scenario you can see the traffic jams and all is a matter of concern.

345
00:35:14,77 --> 00:35:17,15
So, to solve that I feel that [INAUDIBLE] vehicle.

346
00:35:17,15 --> 00:35:24,58
Speaker 1: So is what you see in your daily life, [INAUDIBLE] is you're trying to solve.

347
00:35:24,58 --> 00:35:34,78
Speaker 2: Sure, what I am seeing. But primarily when I'm inventing something, I'm looking at the global aspect..

348
00:35:34,61 --> 00:35:36,42
How globally it [INAUDIBLE] And it always start from one place.

349
00:35:36,42 --> 00:35:42,54
So as being an Indian, I'm looking at how fast I will [INAUDIBLE] to impact in India.

350
00:35:43,08 --> 00:35:46,15
Then the same thing I can replicate to create impact around the globe.

351
00:35:46,15 --> 00:35:47,05
Because everyone is a human being and I believe that humanity matters.

352
00:35:47,05 --> 00:35:56,91
Speaker 1: And in what way is meditation helping you to find solution?

353
00:35:56,91 --> 00:36:05,76
Speaker 2: Yes because I'm looking beyond my imagination, beyond that level that is going to solve the problem.

354
00:36:05,82 --> 00:36:07,58
It's not in my mind that it won't work.

355
00:36:07,91 --> 00:36:15,61
So that comes, that extra, that power is required to think different, think unique.

356
00:36:15,61 --> 00:36:26,4
So I feel that because of that, I'm able to think beyond my imagination, beyond that capacity.,

357
00:36:23,07 --> 00:36:35,63
May be different from people [INAUDIBLE] but I feel that helps me, that drives me to deliver something, really..

358
00:36:30,74 --> 00:36:35,63
Speaker 1: And what's happening when you're meditating? Can you explain me what's happening in your head then?

359
00:36:35,63 --> 00:36:42,31
Speaker 2: See I am able to visualize, I will be able to visualize my vision.

360
00:36:42,31 --> 00:36:48,84
Our vision is to impact, to empower 50 million users worldwide in the next five years.

361
00:36:48,84 --> 00:36:56,85
So I'm able to visualize that, how we are going. If we are going in right direction or wrong, what we should do next.

362
00:36:56,85 --> 00:37:13,34
I'm able to see that. In the form of a dream or in the form of a video. What do I see when I am closing my eyes.

363
00:37:13,34 --> 00:37:16,34
I'm able to see that, ideas. What [INAUDIBLE] show now, we are going in this direction.

364
00:37:16,38 --> 00:37:17,19
Or there is some problem and we should shift to this direction. Or we should do this to create more impact.

365
00:37:17,19 --> 00:37:17,51
So I'm able to scan that five-year vision.

366
00:37:17,51 --> 00:37:20,83
What I have done now, where we are standing, what we have to do more to stand, at this position.

367
00:37:20,83 --> 00:37:26,48
So how this can multiply through that impact we're created from millions to billions.

368
00:37:26,71 --> 00:37:34,93
So how it can, i just, we are able to visualize that and we strictly focused to our vision.

369
00:37:34,93 --> 00:37:35,13
And we assume that if will,

370
00:37:35,13 --> 00:37:43,58
I think that vision in the next five years we will even active in the if you were able to at least 50% of our.

371
00:37:45,18 --> 00:37:58,13
In the next five years, that has been it will multiply to billions in next five or next 10 to 15 years billions

372
00:37:58,13 --> 00:38:00,01
or automatically. Through mouth publicity or through the noise, which will be created.

373
00:38:00,01 --> 00:38:04,79
It will automatically get multiplied. So we don't need to then focus to impact billions.

374
00:38:05,63 --> 00:38:09,19
If we can impact millions, then automatically it will multiply to billions.

375
00:38:09,19 --> 00:38:15,34
Speaker 1: Where you say visualize, what happens in your head? Can you explain me the different steps?

376
00:38:15,34 --> 00:38:16,16
Speaker 2: Yeah three.

377
00:38:16,16 --> 00:38:26,05
Speaker 1: For these three hours of medication..

378
00:38:17,8 --> 00:38:20,57
Speaker 2: Actually in this [INAUDIBLE] we have chakras.

379
00:38:26,38 --> 00:38:35,56
We can say crown [INAUDIBLE] in English there is [INAUDIBLE] throat, this is to the heart,

380
00:38:35,56 --> 00:38:44,65
so you are energized as you can say. All these when you some there's some extra energy in the universe.

381
00:38:45,62 --> 00:38:55,96
So when you meditate, when you use like I actually I'll do the advance which is mantra healing.

382
00:38:55,98 --> 00:39:02,49
Reykian mantra healing I do generally. So in that I just transfer the cosmic energy to my body..

383
00:38:59,53 --> 00:39:03,37
And in that process obviously that energy enters through here to [INAUDIBLE] And then it's [INAUDIBLE]

384
00:39:03,37 --> 00:39:12,05
to the outer environment. So that enters [INAUDIBLE] body. Then there is the effect to the environment.

385
00:39:16,95 --> 00:39:30,14
So that energy helps you to gain that strength and that confidence that overall development you get..

386
00:39:27,81 --> 00:39:35,63
You get a power to [INAUDIBLE] That is most important. The people that are successful at [INAUDIBLE] right thing.

387
00:39:37,47 --> 00:39:44,37
So that things you will feel that you are able to get that confidence that yes this is the right decision you are

388
00:39:44,37 --> 00:39:47,74
taking. This is a right time to do this work.

389
00:39:47,74 --> 00:39:53,47
This type of development I feel that it happens [INAUDIBLE] and it will hit you

390
00:39:53,47 --> 00:39:54,86
and the energy will hit you into the body. Yes you will feel that hit if you are doing it properly.

391
00:39:54,86 --> 00:39:57,27
Speaker 1: And it's three hours a day.

392
00:39:57,27 --> 00:40:07,12
Speaker 2: I do one for five hours you can say.

393
00:40:07,12 --> 00:40:08,19
Speaker 1: Five hours?

394
00:40:08,19 --> 00:40:10,88
Speaker 2: Not five hours, two hours thirty minutes.

395
00:40:10,88 --> 00:40:11,69
Speaker 1: Okay.

396
00:40:11,69 --> 00:40:12,76
Speaker 2: 2.5 hours.

397
00:40:12,76 --> 00:40:21,33
Speaker 1: And then you're completely heated?.

398
00:40:15,72 --> 00:40:22,31
Speaker 2: Yeah completely heated and that aggression and energy has created [INAUDIBLE] If I plan this,

399
00:40:22,7 --> 00:40:36,13
I will be able to achieve this. I don't know, I've got that extra boost, you can say.

400
00:40:36,13 --> 00:40:39,62
To move that with that force to achieve that vision.

401
00:40:42,53 --> 00:40:44,19
Every day I'm doing something that my vision is getting achieved everyday.

402
00:40:44,19 --> 00:40:50,82
Everyday I am just putting a drop of that to fulfill that vision.

403
00:40:50,82 --> 00:40:58,45
Speaker 1: And when you could explain that vision that you have. What is it?

404
00:40:59,07 --> 00:41:02,54
The vision you have, where are you in five, ten years?

405
00:41:02,54 --> 00:41:11,6
Speaker 2: Yeah in the next five years, we are just visualizing to impact 50 million users in the next five years.

406
00:41:11,6 --> 00:41:15,46
And to achieve the 50 million users obviously and that's who [INAUDIBLE] products.

407
00:41:15,46 --> 00:41:24,96
So we are now making a product in such a way that millions of people are going to buy this product.

408
00:41:25,29 --> 00:41:27,37
They would like to feel [INAUDIBLE]

409
00:41:27,37 --> 00:41:32,99
special by which it will make them feel for awhile that special if they wear this device, so to make them that feel.

410
00:41:32,99 --> 00:41:40,47
So we're just trying to create that [INAUDIBLE] in such a way that people will just love to get this product.

411
00:41:40,69 --> 00:41:42,49
Will feel special at getting this product.

412
00:41:42,95 --> 00:41:47,86
So we are doing that so and we are [INAUDIBLE] in a couple of months we will do this

413
00:41:47,86 --> 00:41:50,54
and we will just put this product to the market.

414
00:41:51,17 --> 00:41:54,48
And then it will just multiply to where from thousands to millions then millions you keep on increasing.

415
00:41:54,63 --> 00:41:58,65
But yes the graph will be like this like this ups and downs will come, be we'll show [INAUDIBLE]

416
00:41:58,65 --> 00:42:10,48
that if we get some critiques we'll keep on doing value to that and that we're doing through pilot testings.

417
00:42:10,48 --> 00:42:21,21
We're doing a lot of pilot testings, a lot of trials, and what the critiques are getting we're just improving that..

418
00:42:20,89 --> 00:42:21,36
We're improving our features but we are just besides [INAUDIBLE] Will do it fashionable design

419
00:42:21,36 --> 00:42:24,77
and what we will do we will put that in front of the public and public will present that.

420
00:42:24,77 --> 00:42:39,99
Speaker 1: You were 16 eight years ago. So you have now an eight year, you have 25 people working with you?

421
00:42:39,99 --> 00:42:40,43
Speaker 2: Yeah.

422
00:42:40,43 --> 00:42:43,79
Speaker 1: Where did you make your money off the last eight years?

423
00:42:43,79 --> 00:42:48,15
Speaker 2: Obviously our products are not yet launching into market

424
00:42:48,16 --> 00:42:52,27
but we have started creating a noise of the product, that this is going to be launching to market.

425
00:42:52,28 --> 00:42:54,65
But doing a lot of pilot testing, trials on the people.

426
00:42:55,16 --> 00:43:08,68
The money we are getting is through [INAUDIBLE] business which is our secondary business..

427
00:43:02,34 --> 00:43:05,67
But let me kind of say of our organization.

428
00:43:08,68 --> 00:43:13,83
So we'll do something [INAUDIBLE] projects for industries for corporates, for governments,

429
00:43:14,2 --> 00:43:32,75
and through this becomes one of the revenue source for company as of the present..

430
00:43:22,18 --> 00:43:32,5
And second it creates an experience to a team and to make them [INAUDIBLE] diversify knowledge [INAUDIBLE]

431
00:43:33,24 --> 00:43:49,2
And we take such projects that would help us make our products better. We don't do every kind of confidential business.

432
00:43:49,2 --> 00:43:50,06
We are very focused, even if we are doing a confidential business,

433
00:43:50,06 --> 00:43:52,79
we are focused on which kind of innovations we would take from our clients.

434
00:43:52,99 --> 00:44:09,01
We take those products which would help our team get experience so that they can do in our products.

435
00:44:09,01 --> 00:44:09,82
Speaker 1: And what kind of [INAUDIBLE] it's very general.

436
00:44:09,82 --> 00:44:12,35
Speaker 2: We are into IOT automation and we are [INAUDIBLE] to these areas, automation, IOT solutions.

437
00:44:12,35 --> 00:44:17,91
Although there are products, many things happen but we are [INAUDIBLE] to this, if any of the product or [INAUDIBLE]

438
00:44:18,26 --> 00:44:24,98
that has any of this sectors like mechanics and all, we just outsource it to some other organization

439
00:44:24,98 --> 00:44:26,64
or to other collaborated partners.

440
00:44:26,64 --> 00:44:38,02
Speaker 1: And looking at yourself as a person, six years, you were first awarded at 17, I think?

441
00:44:38,02 --> 00:44:38,45
Speaker 2: At my 16.

442
00:44:38,45 --> 00:44:39,64
Speaker 1: At 16, you were awarded?

443
00:44:39,64 --> 00:44:40,32
Speaker 2: Yeah.

444
00:44:40,32 --> 00:44:46,3
Speaker 1: And then what kind of awards you built afterwards till.

445
00:44:46,3 --> 00:44:51,48
Speaker 2: So like inter level I got the NASA I know so many it happened all of a sudden.

446
00:44:51,6 --> 00:45:08,81
Because when our [INAUDIBLE] automatically obviously you will get that boost, natural boost,

447
00:44:54,54 --> 00:45:08,81
or such innovations so you will be rewarded next and next.,

448
00:45:01,15 --> 00:45:16,13
So you got to at least express when you got [INAUDIBLE] so you learn that see [INAUDIBLE] after so many failures..

449
00:45:10,79 --> 00:45:19,48
[INAUDIBLE] and fail means [INAUDIBLE] learning. So that's also [INAUDIBLE] You use a fail first to achieve something.

450
00:45:19,48 --> 00:45:25,17
So you learn through fail and you also learn by achieving that, so you are particular what to do and what not to do.

451
00:45:25,17 --> 00:45:28,33
Speaker 1: So what is it that you will not do [INAUDIBLE]

452
00:45:28,33 --> 00:45:31,56
Speaker 2: I command both then when I think of version, [INAUDIBLE] other things.

453
00:45:31,63 --> 00:45:35,72
When I'm doing this [INAUDIBLE] what should I not do and what should I do?

454
00:45:37,68 --> 00:45:42,31
And by which [INAUDIBLE] thought what to do and what not do. All the [INAUDIBLE] what I am doing.

455
00:45:42,31 --> 00:45:51,19
I can go hours in various organizations and [INAUDIBLE]

456
00:45:51,19 --> 00:45:58,91
Speaker 1: And would you sum up briefly, what kind of innovations and inventions you did?

457
00:45:59,09 --> 00:46:00,39
Can you tell me several things.

458
00:46:00,39 --> 00:46:06,97
Speaker 2: [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] Very long. Okay fine one is the in a you can see the of which I just described.

459
00:46:07,33 --> 00:46:17,31
One is the low cluster. I mean, one kit, one accidental technology.

460
00:46:18,52 --> 00:46:27,21
Because in the is far from the mountains, because of the night with the roads are not visible [INAUDIBLE]

461
00:46:27,21 --> 00:46:28,43
for people from the mountain.

462
00:46:29,04 --> 00:46:38,32
So that now would just design a kit that can be implemented in a vehicle by which the vehicle stopping there is no

463
00:46:38,32 --> 00:46:41,27
place to move. If there is a hole, or there's a pit. There is road end.

464
00:46:41,27 --> 00:46:49,13
If there is no road cause the vehicle will stop and then it will slightly move back and put the brake.

465
00:46:49,13 --> 00:46:50,13
Speaker 1: And.

466
00:46:50,13 --> 00:46:58,74
Speaker 2: Yes, sure, and one's that low cost product for the villagers and for the rural empowerment,

467
00:46:58,74 --> 00:47:03,61
we did that device, that gate which can provide electricity to the villagers at a very affordable price.

468
00:47:06,65 --> 00:47:12,13
Then we did your driver less kit which can implement in a vehicle to, I mean to make the completely driver less car.

469
00:47:12,46 --> 00:47:29,66
Yeah, then we designed a kit which can be implemented in any of the home.

470
00:47:29,66 --> 00:47:36,44
Whenever you will be inside the home, inside the room, there will be the electrical appliances will be active.

471
00:47:36,44 --> 00:47:40,7
Whenever you leave the room, the electricity will automatically go off,

472
00:47:40,85 --> 00:47:43,38
because generally we forget to switch off the device and all.

473
00:47:43,6 --> 00:47:51,33
So whenever you are in the lighting should be there, whenever you are not there, the lighting should be off.

474
00:47:51,33 --> 00:47:55,44
At a very low cost, affordable price. Then,

475
00:47:55,44 --> 00:48:05,06
Speaker 2: Then some universals, which is not Exactly. I mean useful for the public data.

476
00:48:05,06 --> 00:48:08,39
[INAUDIBLE] For instance for a [INAUDIBLE] since we did some.

477
00:48:08,72 --> 00:48:20,82
These are the innovations which [INAUDIBLE] something [INAUDIBLE]

478
00:48:20,82 --> 00:48:27,97
which is going to create interest in the youth-first technology towards innovations.

479
00:48:27,97 --> 00:48:40,75
If we don't have [INAUDIBLE] has an indirect benefit. For entertainment purpose, for educational purpose.

480
00:48:41,1 --> 00:48:47,87
And during my seminars where I am the guest speaker in colleges or in corporations

481
00:48:47,87 --> 00:48:52,02
or schools I used to display such gadgets. And creates interest in the youth towards technology.

482
00:48:52,02 --> 00:48:55,55
So the [INAUDIBLE] that will be operated from hand gestures. Whether I will move my hand or don't really move.

483
00:48:55,96 --> 00:48:59,4
And [INAUDIBLE] designed it. I [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] hard hard work. Then the ripples will get activate.

484
00:48:59,4 --> 00:49:01,71
And like the hand and the chest will get activate.

485
00:49:01,92 --> 00:49:08,86
So these are some of the innovations that create interest in youth because they can connect with,

486
00:49:08,86 --> 00:49:17,96
they're really super heroes. That they have seen this super heroes in a television, in a movie.

487
00:49:17,96 --> 00:49:22,92
But they know that that's animated. When they see that thing in a real form, in a form of universal.

488
00:49:23,09 --> 00:49:28,09
So they think that the innovation is so wonderful, so beautiful.

489
00:49:28,09 --> 00:49:38,99
So entirely that field you know so this technology is really interesting.

490
00:49:38,99 --> 00:49:39,27
So they are then driven by passion towards networks and technology universal economy.

491
00:49:39,27 --> 00:49:43,5
Speaker 1: That when I hear these examples, which are very nice, but I also think immediately but I've seen that there,

492
00:49:43,5 --> 00:49:44,91
I've seen it in the US. I've seen it in Europe.

493
00:49:44,91 --> 00:49:45,23
Speaker 2: Yeah.

494
00:49:45,23 --> 00:49:52,36
Speaker 1: I've seen it. So why don't they import that in India instead of waiting for your innovations to be made?

495
00:49:52,36 --> 00:49:58,05
Speaker 2: See, there might be something [INAUDIBLE] better than me. [INAUDIBLE] better than which I have done.

496
00:49:58,05 --> 00:50:10,03
But it's all about to find a test. To find a test in the customer, offer that to your customer.

497
00:50:10,03 --> 00:50:15,7
When you do innovation you find, who are targeted customer, what are targeted area.

498
00:50:18,29 --> 00:50:22,1
I will give an example and from that example you will find answer. Both took the example of Amazon and.

499
00:50:22,1 --> 00:50:28,96
They both are the great companies. And Amazon is obviously here and flip [INAUDIBLE] and everyone knows that.

500
00:50:28,96 --> 00:50:32,54
Only one thing you can find in India there is a lot of companies like this.

501
00:50:32,92 --> 00:50:38,27
Amazon, there is, so in India Amazon already [INAUDIBLE] but there's some in India that [INAUDIBLE] there is SnapDeal,

502
00:50:38,27 --> 00:50:45,61
there are many e-commerce companies. [INAUDIBLE] was the one who aggressively captured the Indian market first.

503
00:50:45,8 --> 00:50:54,79
And why? Because of the one simplified feature that improved it. Amazon is far much better and big than Flipkart.

504
00:50:54,79 --> 00:50:55,39
But Flipkart wins in capturing the Indian market.

505
00:50:55,52 --> 00:51:02,41
Because the person, the cofounder, the owner of the Flipkart is Indian,

506
00:51:02,41 --> 00:51:05,08
and he thought that what that innovative feature can be done.

507
00:51:05,31 --> 00:51:15,66
That can add a test in the [INAUDIBLE] so that can add [INAUDIBLE] so the people would like to eat that food...

508
00:51:12,58 --> 00:51:15,32
And what you do he just included [INAUDIBLE] Which Amazon included [INAUDIBLE] but that time hit the [INAUDIBLE]

509
00:51:25,62 --> 00:51:25,87
And people aggressively followed FlipKart.

510
00:51:25,87 --> 00:51:27,62
Because in Indians people don't generally trust on e-commerce if they are passed then the letter get the products.

511
00:51:28,01 --> 00:51:37,84
In India feel that hand to hand. Give the product, they take the money.

512
00:51:40,2 --> 00:51:45,99
So that one filter that created relatively, he get there completely the Indian market.

513
00:51:46,84 --> 00:51:51,53
So the question was to hire the from nine thousand one-th of the I am looking into that.

514
00:51:51,53 --> 00:52:02,96
I am adding such features which is, for whom I am targeting the area of the customers, I mean, my target customers,

515
00:52:02,96 --> 00:52:16,3
in a particular area, to whom I am targeting, I am very focused at, these are the target customers whom I am focusing..

516
00:52:10,23 --> 00:52:10,76
Indians, let's say.

517
00:52:16,3 --> 00:52:23,19
If I'm looking into US I will do some changes in the features.

518
00:52:23,19 --> 00:52:36,18
If I look in the Saudi, Arab countries, I do some changes in the features..

519
00:52:33,08 --> 00:52:35,85
So for different place, in Hindi there is a statement like, [FOREIGN]

520
00:52:36,18 --> 00:52:47,03
Speaker 2: New place, new people, so you have to act accordingly as per their taste and all.

521
00:52:47,03 --> 00:52:48,92
You have to modify so, I mean, new place, there will be new people.

522
00:52:48,92 --> 00:52:52,17
So, I mean, in say, one product which will be liked by Indian may not be liked by British,

523
00:52:52,17 --> 00:52:59,89
also may not be liked by people in US. The product which will be liked by US, may not be liked by Indians.

524
00:52:59,97 --> 00:53:07,52
So the product you have to keep on changing small minor things you have to do if you are changing from target custom

525
00:53:07,52 --> 00:53:13,26
variable. Tending the direction of your customers. When you use Indian, ABC should be a filter.

526
00:53:13,75 --> 00:53:19,6
When it's US it should be BCD. If it is British house it maybe DEF. So in that way.

527
00:53:20,13 --> 00:53:24,23
So if I'm focusing India, so if Indians are not focusing on the I'd rather then focus on this for them.

528
00:53:24,48 --> 00:53:39,11
Because I found that this ABC is going to attract them to create interest in them. It's as simple as it is.

529
00:53:39,11 --> 00:53:45,42
Speaker 1: So the uniqueness is also that you were in this hospital looking at this man, trying,

530
00:53:45,42 --> 00:53:45,68
needing a wheelchair that he could move himself.

531
00:53:45,68 --> 00:53:46,05
Speaker 2: Yes, himself, but main thing they should be affordable.

532
00:53:46,05 --> 00:53:49,78
If they import a wheelchair that could be cost more than two or three or half a millions.

533
00:53:50,11 --> 00:53:58,38
At least they know that this wheelchair which I have developed is low cost, is affordable.

534
00:53:58,56 --> 00:54:03,88
Even I give flexible options. I give flexible options like don't have [INAUDIBLE] wheelchair.

535
00:54:03,88 --> 00:54:17,68
When you donate a wheelchair you can get the kit at the price of 15 to 20,000 rupees.

536
00:54:17,68 --> 00:54:18,83
Can get this kit, you can sit and [INAUDIBLE] and you can operate electrical appliances, you can text messages.

537
00:54:18,88 --> 00:54:21,24
If you want the mobility of some, we can [INAUDIBLE] local [INAUDIBLE] for you.

538
00:54:21,24 --> 00:54:25,38
[INAUDIBLE] for you and your customers [INAUDIBLE] and we can implement [INAUDIBLE] in the wheelchair.

539
00:54:26,49 --> 00:54:40,76
So providing that special option to the target customer makes them feel special?

540
00:54:39,69 --> 00:54:40,7
and they choose you rather than choosing any other. Why they will invest [INAUDIBLE]

541
00:54:40,76 --> 00:54:44,8
Speaker 2: I mean more money if they're getting the special thing [INAUDIBLE]

542
00:54:44,8 --> 00:54:49,11
so I know that what exactly is going to attract Indian customers.

543
00:54:49,11 --> 00:54:56,55
Speaker 1: And how many wheelchair owners or people that are disabled are using your kit?

544
00:54:56,55 --> 00:55:03,35
Speaker 2: Currently there will be more than twenty, i can say will be, but in a formal pilot testing,

545
00:55:03,35 --> 00:55:05,94
because this is not a product which we are commercializing at our own brand.

546
00:55:06,5 --> 00:55:09,46
So, during the pilot testings and through some tie-up organisations.

547
00:55:09,91 --> 00:55:14,61
I mean, they just develop some of the units and we helped them in developing those and kits units

548
00:55:14,61 --> 00:55:26,92
and it was been [INAUDIBLE] by many of the users. Maybe to at the hospitals in this way.

549
00:55:26,92 --> 00:55:27,03
But officially we're not commercializing this.

550
00:55:27,05 --> 00:55:32,92
We are [INAUDIBLE] with the companies so that they can commercialize in a better way.

551
00:55:32,92 --> 00:55:35,28
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not commercialized yet.

552
00:55:35,28 --> 00:55:36,17
Speaker 2: Yes.

553
00:55:36,17 --> 00:55:41,28
Speaker 1: No and when you look around the globe, who are your heroes?

554
00:55:41,28 --> 00:55:46,58
Who would, when you envision somebody that you would like to be can you think of one.

555
00:55:46,58 --> 00:55:50,75
Speaker 2: Every successful people and every unsuccessful people are my heroes.

556
00:55:50,75 --> 00:55:54,97
From successful people I learn what to do and from every unsuccessful people I learn what not to do. [INAUDIBLE]

557
00:55:54,97 --> 00:56:09,39
Speaker 2: Like I said [INAUDIBLE] Steve Jobs. Each one of them, like Elon Musk, these people have massively done that.

558
00:56:09,58 --> 00:56:15,41
I learned everything [INAUDIBLE] I learned what other things make mistakes and [INAUDIBLE] to reach that level.

559
00:56:15,41 --> 00:56:23,2
From there I learned that what I should not do and what I should do.

560
00:56:25,23 --> 00:56:29,34
So that I can reach that [INAUDIBLE] at our [INAUDIBLE] you feel that I am [INAUDIBLE]

561
00:56:29,34 --> 00:56:38,24
at a young age because of that I try to learn from other's experience.

562
00:56:38,57 --> 00:56:45,71
By what they have down which they got a downfall, what they have done got an achievement.

563
00:56:45,71 --> 00:56:50,87
Like if you take the example of Elon Musk,

564
00:56:50,87 --> 00:56:54,25
like PayPal whatever he has earned like around $150 million he earned through PayPal,

565
00:56:54,25 --> 00:56:56,89
he invested into completely into Tesla Motors and SpaceX. We don't know why he did.

566
00:56:57,06 --> 00:56:59,04
He even didn't establish single penny. I mean he borrowed.

567
00:56:59,04 --> 00:57:03,86
In those days, he was borrowing from his friends and he was staying in a rented house.

568
00:57:04,02 --> 00:57:08,01
I don't know [INAUDIBLE] did what. But I think he was more focused to the vision.

569
00:57:08,01 --> 00:57:13,99
When you don't want [INAUDIBLE] you can invest that [INAUDIBLE] he did that.

570
00:57:14,04 --> 00:57:21,82
He was completely involved in fulfilling his vision. So for many [INAUDIBLE] has done is right.

571
00:57:21,82 --> 00:57:26,34
Speaker 1: And when you put it on yourself. What makes you a visionary for others who think?

572
00:57:26,34 --> 00:57:32,47
Speaker 2: See, I notice every human can tend to think they should have a luxurious life, or a royal life.

573
00:57:32,8 --> 00:57:40,25
He should have a bungalow, he should have a car, he should have luxurious vehicles. He should lead a royal lifestyle.

574
00:57:40,25 --> 00:57:49,62
Every human being wants that. But there are some people that to achieve that, they just focus on that.

575
00:57:49,62 --> 00:57:56,18
How are we going to achieve that, how we are going to achieve a big house, how will drive our dream car,

576
00:57:56,32 --> 00:57:59,4
or how we will have a lot of bank balance, they focus on that.

577
00:57:59,61 --> 00:58:04,81
There are some people, like, I also want that kind of life. But I'm not focusing to do that.

578
00:58:04,81 --> 00:58:14,4
I know that if I should focus to my vision, everything will come, everything will put in my place.

579
00:58:14,4 --> 00:58:14,81
So everything will be put in the place.

580
00:58:14,81 --> 00:58:22,84
I don't need to focus how much my bank balance, whether I have my dream house or not, or whether I have a mansion

581
00:58:22,84 --> 00:58:25,28
or not, do I have a dream car or not. I don't need to focus there.

582
00:58:25,28 --> 00:58:30,1
I know that all this all this dreams will be fulfilled if I fulfill my vision. If I stick to my vision.

583
00:58:30,58 --> 00:58:38,39
Everything will get put in my bag. So this all will be put in my list. So I just stick to the vision.

584
00:58:38,85 --> 00:58:44,96
I know that I can accept that by focusing on the vision. So, if I from the vision, everything will go, go away.

585
00:58:44,96 --> 00:58:50,43
And but the real happiness that I'm going to get is when vision is fulfilled.

586
00:58:50,61 --> 00:58:58,69
If I find and someone says, users changed my life, changed my life.

587
00:58:58,82 --> 00:59:10,27
That is real, my achievement, rather than the of this and this, house or dream, that is my dream house or dream car.

588
00:59:10,64 --> 00:59:11,18
I can hear a that this has reality saved my life. Thank you so much.

589
00:59:11,24 --> 00:59:16,27
If I hear this small statement from any of my users, I am more than happy.

590
00:59:16,27 --> 00:59:26,00
Speaker 1: And I understand that, but then still, why are you, in the eyes of other people, a visionary?

591
00:59:26,00 --> 00:59:33,5
Speaker 2: Because I stick to my vision. Every time the activities I do that gives value to the vision.

592
00:59:33,82 --> 00:59:43,59
And what [INAUDIBLE] I do I step every day I step one ladder to reach the destination of the vision

593
00:59:43,59 --> 00:59:50,26
and people can see if I'm doing that that will be. Seen by others and that's why they feel that I am visionary.

594
00:59:50,26 --> 00:59:53,72
Speaker 1: So you will be the next Elon Musk, probably.

595
00:59:53,72 --> 00:59:54,67
Speaker 2: Yeah, why not? I'd love to.

596
00:59:54,67 --> 01:00:01,09
Speaker 1: First of all, you wanted to tell something about your big example.

597
01:00:01,09 --> 01:00:06,18
Speaker 2: Yeah first you asked, whether I wanted to be the next Elon Musk.

598
01:00:14,77 --> 01:00:20,61
I will say yes, I want to be the next Elon Musk of India. I can say because Elon Musk is a really great entrepeneur.

599
01:00:20,67 --> 01:00:24,47
And first I will be myself, I will be who's similar to next Elon Musk of India.

600
01:00:24,47 --> 01:00:33,91
So obviously with my uniqueness, with my some innovative mind and entrepreneurial mind obviously.

601
01:00:34,04 --> 01:00:35,06
If I would have fulfilled that vision,

602
01:00:35,06 --> 01:00:40,45
I would have been able to I think the vision if I had been able to impact millions of life, billions of life

603
01:00:40,45 --> 01:00:46,12
and obviously to reach that percentage is will be not a big deal.

604
01:00:46,12 --> 01:00:47,83
Speaker 1: And what is your vision?

605
01:00:47,83 --> 01:00:50,71
Speaker 2: Yeah, just what I just mentioned before.

606
01:00:50,92 --> 01:00:56,75
I like to empower 15 million users worldwide in the next five years.

607
01:00:56,75 --> 01:01:04,89
Then, and obviously to raise a billion will be very easier if that vision is active in the next five years.

608
01:01:04,89 --> 01:01:10,49
Speaker 1: What kind of problems do you encounter here in India? I suppose it's not all one success story.

609
01:01:10,49 --> 01:01:14,65
Speaker 2: See, if you want to find problems, and you should come to India, I can say.

610
01:01:14,65 --> 01:01:17,5
So there is lot more and we take problems as achievement.

611
01:01:17,5 --> 01:01:23,05
If there is a problem, then that's achievement because there is a lot many things that we can learn

612
01:01:23,61 --> 01:01:30,33
and a lot many things we can explore. And where we can use our mind to develop something which can solve that problem.

613
01:01:30,33 --> 01:01:37,95
And that problem may be directly and indirectly will be finished by the other parts of the world as well.

614
01:01:37,95 --> 01:01:41,39
So that can greater impact in that areas as well.

615
01:01:41,39 --> 01:01:47,04
So anything that is, in modern India it's not only solving the problems of Indian politics,

616
01:01:47,04 --> 01:01:50,06
it's also solving the problems of the global people as well.

617
01:01:50,06 --> 01:01:56,01
Speaker 1: So you see Indian problems and try to find solutions for that?

618
01:01:56,01 --> 01:01:57,68
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.

619
01:01:57,68 --> 01:02:09,78
Speaker 1: And the question whether what makes what you invent more unique than what already exists in the world?

620
01:02:09,78 --> 01:02:20,05
Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] how very inadvertently I have done any invention.

621
01:02:20,05 --> 01:02:21,61
It happens finally but that depends to make it more user-friendly. I don't look to make it user-friendly.

622
01:02:24,29 --> 01:02:30,15
If something that is similar to the existing innovation, if my innovation has some extra one features,

623
01:02:30,15 --> 01:02:33,07
I would like to market that innovation.

624
01:02:33,07 --> 01:02:37,34
I would like to present innovation to the market whether it's from my organization company

625
01:02:37,34 --> 01:02:41,57
or whether through organization or whether it's in the collaboration with other organizations or companies.

626
01:02:42,06 --> 01:02:48,85
So if there, by evaluating that one feature in a resident industry, you're really creating impact.

627
01:02:49,3 --> 01:02:55,95
And I would like to push that. If we, to make it more user-friendly, then we can get a great computer data system.

628
01:02:55,95 --> 01:03:02,86
So it happens when I'm focusing to make it user-friendly. It becomes innovation.

629
01:03:02,86 --> 01:03:08,36
Speaker 1: I, for this series we filmed in the most modern elapse you can imagine.

630
01:03:08,36 --> 01:03:15,48
The unique, yesterday in the fap lab I have to admit it was not the most modern.

631
01:03:17,28 --> 01:03:21,98
How is it that fap lab that come the newest innovation?

632
01:03:21,98 --> 01:03:33,33
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's type of place where allow other makers to privilege lab.

633
01:03:35,89 --> 01:03:40,89
We just provide privilege and access to that lab.

634
01:03:40,89 --> 01:03:45,00
They can access the lab, the they can do something to prototypes and products.

635
01:03:45,00 --> 01:03:50,22
Like yesterday you filmed that and you saw that how there are some different methods.

636
01:03:50,22 --> 01:03:53,15
So we're doing some different things.

637
01:03:53,15 --> 01:03:58,68
So we just try to create that ecosystem where the other methods and [INAUDIBLE] will come and open a model.

638
01:03:59,01 --> 01:04:02,34
Like open work space so people can do team.

639
01:04:05,07 --> 01:04:09,86
They will do they will do but finally they will do something that is going to create an impact.

640
01:04:10,39 --> 01:04:17,36
So that's a will be provided at a young age, at a year, and then they will get impact at such,

641
01:04:17,75 --> 01:04:21,51
when they will come to at least In their 30s or 40s.

642
01:04:22,1 --> 01:04:25,19
So if they will keep struggling till their 30s or 40s then obviously, if they will utilize that time

643
01:04:25,19 --> 01:04:32,94
and effort in creating that space, then they will start working and it will consume a lot of time.

644
01:04:32,94 --> 01:04:34,13
Efficiency will decrease.

645
01:04:34,72 --> 01:04:44,13
So now that these guys Only to give effort to, I mean, to create a vast space, which we have already created.

646
01:04:44,47 --> 01:04:49,66
So there's a need to execute their ideas into products, and push to the market.

647
01:04:49,66 --> 01:04:56,34
We also help project ecosystem, that manufacturing peak ecosystem, that talent ecosystem, Getting tie ups

648
01:04:56,34 --> 01:05:01,72
or collaborate some ecosystems by which that can sort of get into market at earliest as possible.

649
01:05:01,72 --> 01:05:12,25
Speaker 1: So is that good? The television experience you had??

650
01:05:05,04 --> 01:05:12,17
So it is good to have a bit of a clumsy kind of lab because there you can discover and invent. Is that [CROSSTALK]

651
01:05:12,25 --> 01:05:13,79
Speaker 2: And obviously, when there are more and more, if you provide space to other makers

652
01:05:13,79 --> 01:05:22,11
and innovators will come other makers and innovators, too. Worker and under one umbrella.

653
01:05:22,11 --> 01:05:31,16
Now with that ecosystem where we can discuss each other, we can create critics each other

654
01:05:31,16 --> 01:05:33,86
and finally a best strategy will come out of that. Only you think to develop and a team will think to develop.

655
01:05:34,27 --> 01:05:39,98
So obviously the team is going to create the impact.

656
01:05:39,98 --> 01:05:42,31
Speaker 1: It's like you created a place where you can research the television.

657
01:05:42,31 --> 01:05:42,91
Speaker 2: Yes.

658
01:05:42,91 --> 01:05:47,7
Speaker 1: Something like that, yeah. When I hear you, you- [INAUDIBLE]

659
01:05:47,7 --> 01:05:52,81
Speaker 1: Did you have your vest open or closed?

660
01:05:52,81 --> 01:05:57,17
Speaker 2: Closed, closed, so this closed, closed. So it was open?

661
01:05:57,17 --> 01:05:58,5
Speaker 1: It was opened.

662
01:05:58,5 --> 01:06:00,83
Speaker 2: Opened, yeah. Yeah.

663
01:06:00,83 --> 01:06:02,83
Speaker 1: I should open it?

664
01:06:02,83 --> 01:06:09,46
Speaker 2: Yeah. Please, as is was. [INAUDIBLE]

665
01:06:09,46 --> 01:06:11,71
Speaker 1: No. We don't have to do it again, but I mean it's just, from now on it's okay. It's okay. No no no.

666
01:06:11,71 --> 01:06:11,78
Keep it open.

667
01:06:11,78 --> 01:06:14,59
Speaker 2: Sorry sorry. I didn't know.,

668
01:06:12,39 --> 01:06:15,26
Speaker 1: No, that's our responsibility. Yeah.

669
01:06:15,26 --> 01:06:27,85
So when you talk, you talk like a person with a lot of experience, but you're only 24 years old.

670
01:06:27,85 --> 01:06:34,54
Speaker 2: But I have seven years experience in the field of universal and entrepreneurial.

671
01:06:34,54 --> 01:06:39,55
Although I Officially, we have incorporated our company, InThinks, our startup I can say.

672
01:06:39,81 --> 01:06:44,84
Our startup InThinks, Innovators and Thinkers, InThinks. And our slogan is empowering future.

673
01:06:44,84 --> 01:06:51,07
So we have recently incorporated last year, but before officially incorporating, we started a journey.

674
01:06:51,07 --> 01:06:56,94
And through that journey, we have learned a lot of Struggles and all up downs so that gives us experience.

675
01:06:57,31 --> 01:07:11,16
And by [INAUDIBLE] to the global network so that creates a lot of experience to us and still we are learners.

676
01:07:11,25 --> 01:07:11,34
[INAUDIBLE]

677
01:07:11,34 --> 01:07:20,34
we will keep the learning attitude whenever possible from our top leaders to the Failures to even from a child.

678
01:07:20,34 --> 01:07:22,88
If I'm able to learn something [INAUDIBLE] more privileged I am getting a chance to learn.

679
01:07:22,88 --> 01:07:26,96
If I'm interacting with kids they are learning from me and I am learning from them.

680
01:07:27,3 --> 01:07:34,9
[INAUDIBLE] and that's where I think we are progressing on the right direction.

681
01:07:34,9 --> 01:07:35,91
Speaker 1: And are you focused on yourself not on the we form but the I form.

682
01:07:35,91 --> 01:07:39,43
What did you learn personally from the last as you are still quite young.

683
01:07:39,43 --> 01:07:49,07
When you started 16 was your first invention, what did you, what makes you so successful?

684
01:07:49,07 --> 01:08:00,08
Speaker 2: See I just follow my passion, first my passion was this technology so I am just following my passion.

685
01:08:00,08 --> 01:08:00,93
And [INAUDIBLE] to a profession.

686
01:08:00,93 --> 01:08:03,63
And I believe a person is transforming his passion to a profession then [INAUDIBLE]

687
01:08:03,63 --> 01:08:08,37
because they're following their heart. Money comes along the way to the journey.

688
01:08:08,7 --> 01:08:16,87
So that is [INAUDIBLE] because you might be doing something which you are earning millions.

689
01:08:17,4 --> 01:08:23,92
But if it went for [INAUDIBLE] unless but this person was following the [INAUDIBLE] is [INAUDIBLE]

690
01:08:23,92 --> 01:08:24,2
because he is happier.

691
01:08:24,2 --> 01:08:34,82
This person always want this thing will be haunting him throughout the day, every night through the night [INAUDIBLE]

692
01:08:34,82 --> 01:08:37,78
at least every night he will feel haunting.

693
01:08:39,92 --> 01:08:50,93
Sleeping in his dreams maybe so he has not actually he was interested or he didn't follow his passion.

694
01:08:50,93 --> 01:09:01,43
He might want to be a good writer but he was doing something a nine to five job or he got a better job in.

695
01:09:01,43 --> 01:09:03,74
He's earning Millions every month but he will regret.

696
01:09:04,00 --> 01:09:08,85
Regret will keep on haunting every night that he didn't follow his passion.

697
01:09:08,85 --> 01:09:16,81
Better than to feel regret is you follow your passion and follow your heart.

698
01:09:16,81 --> 01:09:17,05
Speaker 1: That's what you're doing now?

699
01:09:17,05 --> 01:09:21,8
Speaker 2: Yes, in that way I feel that I'm successful. The rest is whether how much you're crediting better.

700
01:09:22,02 --> 01:09:29,42
How much traveling you have done. How much Money you [INAUDIBLE] that will be just a part of the life.

701
01:09:31,5 --> 01:09:40,39
And that is going to happen [INAUDIBLE] time. So we should not focus on that.

702
01:09:40,39 --> 01:09:46,63
We should focus on following your passion. And through a passion how are you [INAUDIBLE] impact.

703
01:09:46,95 --> 01:09:48,54
These two things matters.

704
01:09:48,54 --> 01:09:56,46
Speaker 1: And Can you give me, what’s for you, let me see. What’s for you a magic word?

705
01:09:56,46 --> 01:10:00,27
I mean, can you give me a word that you think, wow, this drives me?

706
01:10:00,27 --> 01:10:04,64
Speaker 2: See. Always keep [INAUDIBLE] that's what I learned..

707
01:10:03,95 --> 01:10:04,47
Whether you are in a team or in personal life or professional life.

708
01:10:04,64 --> 01:10:05,52
Expectation should be effectiveness. [INAUDIBLE] whether [INAUDIBLE] because you are going to do that.

709
01:10:05,52 --> 01:10:30,15
There's a difference, I will ask my hand. I will think that I should, if there's a water bottle.

710
01:10:30,7 --> 01:10:36,86
I will ask my hand to get that water bottle for me. So I will go and get, I will come.

711
01:10:37,19 --> 01:10:41,92
Now if I explain that I will ask you go get that water bottle for me.

712
01:10:41,92 --> 01:10:58,92
There are two options whether you will get it or [INAUDIBLE] That options for no if I ask [INAUDIBLE] for me...

713
01:10:49,35 --> 01:10:58,84
But if I ask myself go and get a [INAUDIBLE] for me so that [INAUDIBLE] So it will give [INAUDIBLE]

714
01:10:59,09 --> 01:11:05,33
If you are not able to expertly use then how can you challenge your team to that vision?

715
01:11:05,33 --> 01:11:12,1
So on whom we're expecting is a matter of concern.

716
01:11:12,1 --> 01:11:17,75
Speaker 1: This series, every episode has an archetype. And you are in the archetype, the maker.

717
01:11:17,75 --> 01:11:17,77
Speaker 2: Yeah.

718
01:11:17,77 --> 01:11:18,14
Speaker 1: Do you agree with that?

719
01:11:18,14 --> 01:11:34,9
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm a maker first. Because a maker is also an innovator. A maker is also a creator.

720
01:11:34,9 --> 01:11:41,98
So A maker has a free body, is free to do whatever he wants.

721
01:11:41,98 --> 01:11:42,15
He'll try to hack and all, but finally, the result matters when you are an entrepreneur. You are creating impact.

722
01:11:42,17 --> 01:11:45,53
A maker tries to hack anything, destroy anything, create anything,

723
01:11:46,06 --> 01:11:53,31
without focusing that whether it is going to create impact or not. He just tried to create a wow effect out of it.

724
01:11:53,31 --> 01:11:59,9
Which I think when you did the shooting in the fab lab you see how differently we have done some universals and all.

725
01:12:00,24 --> 01:12:10,95
Haphazardly, just to kind of do what you can say. Try to solve a particular problem in that prospective time.

726
01:12:10,95 --> 01:12:12,29
What we didn't because of how that things back.

727
01:12:12,55 --> 01:12:23,84
But finally you have turn it on if we want to make a research to the global people.

728
01:12:24,16 --> 01:12:33,1
So I'm a maker of clash model but finally output on us to create that impact.

729
01:12:33,44 --> 01:12:44,45
By being a make a value not be able to create an impact.

730
01:12:44,45 --> 01:12:44,66
Speaker 1: Okay thank you.

731
01:12:44,66 --> 01:12:45,33
Speaker 2: Kind of with what's now for the schools and that they can afford it. [INAUDIBLE]

732
01:12:45,33 --> 01:12:46,28
Speaker 3: Yeah, could you,

733
01:12:47,17 --> 01:12:55,44
what is the difference in innovating for Indian markets comparing it to other markets world wide, or US markets,

734
01:12:55,44 --> 01:12:57,31
for example? What's the difference?

735
01:12:57,31 --> 01:12:58,64
Speaker 2: Between the innovations?

736
01:12:58,64 --> 01:13:04,2
Speaker 1: What is the difference? In innovating for Indian markets comparing it to other markets?

737
01:13:04,2 --> 01:13:09,93
What makes Indian markets so difficult or special?

738
01:13:09,93 --> 01:13:18,89
Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] which should attract that audience that I should get the product.

739
01:13:18,89 --> 01:13:24,02
[INAUDIBLE] That ISO graded products. Everyone, if they want something in their lives, they need a water bottle.

740
01:13:24,35 --> 01:13:33,35
They have some such ideas. Like they should get more quantity, better quality, they should get it at a price.

741
01:13:33,35 --> 01:13:40,57
So Indian has a mindset as let's keep some credit as if they're get attract to any of the product.

742
01:13:40,57 --> 01:13:50,9
Apart from these three, most important is that if anyone is referring, is giving the testimony of that product,

743
01:13:50,9 --> 01:14:00,72
if any of his friend says, you know, that this XYZ water bottle is very awesome, it tastes better.

744
01:14:00,72 --> 01:14:07,17
Speaker 2: Then that Indian is going to get that product which his friend referred.

745
01:14:07,17 --> 01:14:16,39
So that reference, that mouth of publicity matters first. And then they can do the other qualities..

746
01:14:13,07 --> 01:14:22,00
I'm talking about the [INAUDIBLE] not every but of the [INAUDIBLE].

747
01:14:16,39 --> 01:14:28,42
So your product should be sustainable it should get a [INAUDIBLE] It should get into the people's mouth publicity..

748
01:14:27,77 --> 01:14:28,72
It should make them feel that special, so that they can do [INAUDIBLE] In Indians if you talk about iPads,

749
01:14:28,72 --> 01:14:44,4
less people know the [INAUDIBLE] iPads. What many people [INAUDIBLE] that we can afford an iPad.

750
01:14:44,92 --> 01:14:53,81
And sometimes I feel Apple makes those products to give message that you don't have your own value. Get our product.

751
01:14:54,08 --> 01:15:02,96
That increase your value. Sometimes I maybe wrong [INAUDIBLE] happens more in Indians.

752
01:15:02,96 --> 01:15:11,67
There are people who don't even know to use iPhone properly. They just know how to call..

753
01:15:06,8 --> 01:15:11,42
They don't to use apps and anything but they get an iPhone just to do [INAUDIBLE]

754
01:15:12,19 --> 01:15:20,24
That will add the value in because by getting such products.

755
01:15:20,44 --> 01:15:22,77
I feel that [INAUDIBLE] If you really, if required and really then take it.

756
01:15:22,77 --> 01:15:23,22
Speaker 1: When you personalized that,

757
01:15:23,22 --> 01:15:35,81
so what is going to make you successful at the Indian market instead of other companies that come from abroad?

758
01:15:35,81 --> 01:15:41,13
Speaker 2: So obviously being an Indian, I know the, I understand the mentality of the Indians.

759
01:15:41,66 --> 01:15:50,87
I know what they exactly wants and what I should include in a product so that they will be easily fascinated

760
01:15:50,87 --> 01:15:55,12
or they will be easily attracted towards a product, that would make them feel special.

761
01:15:55,61 --> 01:15:57,84
So everything I am putting into consideration.

762
01:15:57,84 --> 01:16:03,48
So like if people coming from abroad will think to make a product and to put in the market,

763
01:16:03,48 --> 01:16:09,76
they will not understand exactly Indian mindset. Like you can see just recently, if I take the example of Apple.

764
01:16:09,76 --> 01:16:17,73
They just decreased the price of the Apple. And the volume sales increased drastically.

765
01:16:18,79 --> 01:16:31,34
So there might be some Indian in the Apple and they are [INAUDIBLE] might have suggested that if you do this [INAUDIBLE]

766
01:16:31,34 --> 01:16:38,92
it is going to drastically increase the number of sales in India.

767
01:16:38,94 --> 01:16:44,24
So if you want to [INAUDIBLE] on the Indians, it's a great market. It is more than 1 billion populace.

768
01:16:44,24 --> 01:16:54,64
If you know in India so there is more [INAUDIBLE]

769
01:16:55,09 --> 01:17:00,6
and the population is more than 1 billion so you can sell your products in the Indian market so.

770
01:17:01,59 --> 01:17:08,00
If you follow some parameters and that [INAUDIBLE]

771
01:17:08,00 --> 01:17:17,48
obviously if you are from Netherlands than you know better what product has to be done than that is going to

772
01:17:17,48 --> 01:17:21,76
[INAUDIBLE] audience. Or the Netherland people.

773
01:17:22,42 --> 01:17:25,97
I cannot go and I cannot get a [INAUDIBLE] product that will attract them.

774
01:17:26,45 --> 01:17:32,92
If you, if there is a comparison if you saw a product and I saw a product, your product is going to sell.

775
01:17:32,92 --> 01:17:33,94
But, the reverse will be in India.

776
01:17:34,07 --> 01:17:38,29
If I make a product, which your product may be 100 times better than my product,

777
01:17:38,76 --> 01:17:44,53
but I will be including something in that problem, might [INAUDIBLE] because I will knowing that [INAUDIBLE]

778
01:17:44,53 --> 01:17:44,88
Indian mindset.

779
01:17:44,88 --> 01:17:47,37
Speaker 4: [INAUDIBLE] the cost if there's any other

780
01:17:47,37 --> 01:18:02,57
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay well you asked the question already. Are there other parts [INAUDIBLE]

781
01:18:02,57 --> 01:18:05,78
Speaker 2: I told you the main parameter is that it should be [INAUDIBLE] such that [INAUDIBLE]

782
01:18:05,78 --> 01:18:14,76
then low cost won't matter. Right to get the iPhone or to get the Samsung Galaxy type phone.

783
01:18:15,09 --> 01:18:25,61
More costlier than the pocket money that [INAUDIBLE] get. I mean, they somehow get it anyhow.

784
01:18:25,61 --> 01:18:33,66
They borrow from friend, they add all their pocket monies, and all of them they get their iPhone

785
01:18:33,66 --> 01:18:45,77
or their Samsung Galaxy phone. Because that has created a noise. And that has created royalty to individuals.

786
01:18:45,83 --> 01:18:59,02
Among a French community if you are using iPhone or a Samsung you get special treatment. Wow you have an iPhone..

787
01:18:58,85 --> 01:18:58,97
Wow you have a Samsung Galaxy so people appreciate.

788
01:18:59,05 --> 01:19:01,7
And there will be some kids, or some other students that will be jealous that people have that,

789
01:19:01,97 --> 01:19:13,42
that his friend has an iPhone, and I don't have it. So that jealousy, to feel that royal-ness, people buy the product.

790
01:19:13,84 --> 01:19:25,28
And that is more. That is the first thing by which people purchase that product.,

791
01:19:20,81 --> 01:19:29,8
The people who really [INAUDIBLE] are coming into the secondary [INAUDIBLE] that creates a jealousy.

792
01:19:29,8 --> 01:19:38,38
Speaker 2: If a product, if someone is feeling really special, and others are appreciating

793
01:19:38,95 --> 01:19:43,24
and they are feeling jealous that this person has that product, it is creating a wow effect.

794
01:19:43,91 --> 01:19:50,25
Everyone is appreciating wow you have this product. So that jealously will make others to get that product.

795
01:19:51,79 --> 01:19:54,97
I don't know who wins. The company will be [INAUDIBLE] product wins.
