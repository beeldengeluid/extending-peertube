1
00:00:02,68 --> 00:00:07,97
Yes. Absolutely. So is a child.

2
00:00:08,21 --> 00:00:17,84
We were twenty four seven plane sports we would play baseball and summer in the football season we would play football.

3
00:00:18,36 --> 00:00:24,47
We would play soccer the family in which I was raised was really all about sports

4
00:00:24,47 --> 00:00:31,94
and I sort of took that passion to a market called the collectibles market so.

5
00:00:32,76 --> 00:00:40,19
When I was a kid I would grass in the summer and then I would take that money and buy baseball cards

6
00:00:40,19 --> 00:00:48,51
and in the winter I was raised in Wisconsin. So I would shovel snow. I would take that money and buy baseball cards.

7
00:00:49,18 --> 00:00:58,02
And from there. I became this kind of this love of the of the sports card market or the baseball card market you.

8
00:00:58,94 --> 00:01:09,78
Are very well that's right. So trading actually gave me an outlet to use sports.

9
00:01:10,07 --> 00:01:17,91
In a market so markets have always fascinated me things like how are prices determined in markets.

10
00:01:18,02 --> 00:01:24,37
You know when I was a little kid we would pay a quarter for a pack of baseball cards

11
00:01:24,37 --> 00:01:33,26
and I wondered why is it a quarter. Why isn't it. Fifty cents why isn't it a dime and those types of questions always.

12
00:01:34,23 --> 00:01:40,86
Peak my curiosity in thinking about how do markets not only price goods but how do they allocate goods

13
00:01:40,86 --> 00:01:41,57
and services to people.

14
00:01:42,00 --> 00:01:59,9
Yes So let's put it this way that I was unusual as a kid I think I had certain quirks that people might. Deny.

15
00:02:00,15 --> 00:02:06,24
It is peculiar or unusual on the one hand I was constantly playing sports

16
00:02:07,07 --> 00:02:16,16
and on the other I had the intellectual curiosity to think deeply about questions like allocations

17
00:02:16,16 --> 00:02:21,43
and markets without calling it that I thought about grocery stores

18
00:02:21,43 --> 00:02:27,54
and trading markets in ways I think that my colleagues when I was Little did not really have the same thoughts.

19
00:02:33,88 --> 00:02:36,06
Yeah I think that's right. I think in the end.

20
00:02:36,62 --> 00:02:38,94
We end up chasing our dreams

21
00:02:38,94 --> 00:02:59,86
and if we're good enough to do the things that we love then we can make that an occupation or a career. That's right.

22
00:02:59,93 --> 00:03:04,38
Is as I grew older through high school and when I was in college.

23
00:03:04,95 --> 00:03:11,87
I began to be a dealer in these markets so what a dealer does is a dealer brings his

24
00:03:11,87 --> 00:03:17,00
or her sports cards to the market in and sells them or trades them to people

25
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:23,21
and what you could readily see is that not all people were getting the same deal.

26
00:03:23,33 --> 00:03:26,95
Some people would pay a lot more money than another person

27
00:03:26,95 --> 00:03:33,88
and even in those types of markets you could see the inequities that were arise in and I always thought.

28
00:03:34,5 --> 00:03:40,42
What are the factors that are causing those inequities and markets

29
00:03:40,42 --> 00:03:49,46
and what can we do within a free market system to lessen those in equities or make markets more fair.

30
00:03:49,65 --> 00:03:59,88
Well it could be a simple. Women tend to shy away from by.

31
00:04:00,76 --> 00:04:08,03
So what happens in these types of bargaining in markets is that the dealers understand that women shy away from bargain

32
00:04:08,03 --> 00:04:14,78
in so they charge some higher prices and it happens in the used car market it happens in the baseball card market.

33
00:04:15,18 --> 00:04:23,85
It happens in any market where you have bilateral exchange in you have people bargaining over the price that's a severe

34
00:04:23,85 --> 00:04:27,89
inequity that can determine consumption and in concert.

35
00:04:29,49 --> 00:04:44,42
Concerning outcomes of people that are really important like in the labor market. I was pretty good trader.

36
00:04:46,5 --> 00:04:48,18
So just about every weekend.

37
00:04:48,61 --> 00:04:52,76
My girlfriend at the time who became my wife she

38
00:04:52,76 --> 00:04:59,35
and I would go to these large sports car shows we would drive from Madison Wisconsin all the way down to Chicago.

39
00:05:00,03 --> 00:05:06,7
And we would buy sell and trade through time and through experimentation.

40
00:05:06,73 --> 00:05:13,21
I became pretty good at it and I understood kind of what people wanted and how they wanted to bargain

41
00:05:13,21 --> 00:05:16,2
and saw in the long run I think I did pretty well.

42
00:05:18,63 --> 00:05:23,22
I had my experiences so there were some occasions where I was taken advantage of.

43
00:05:24,96 --> 00:05:31,53
I can remember one case where I was trading in a very large trade for me at the time maybe a thousand

44
00:05:31,53 --> 00:05:39,08
or two thousand dollars and I got in return a bunch of counterfeit cards and that that's her bum me out.

45
00:05:39,32 --> 00:05:47,88
I think it's fair to say that I was taken a fool that particular day in the market. They were just fake cards.

46
00:05:48,05 --> 00:05:49,57
That's right. So I've never done that.

47
00:05:49,68 --> 00:05:56,18
Personally I went when I when I buy sell and trade I try to predict what will be good in the future.

48
00:05:56,35 --> 00:05:59,66
So what is a down sports card today.

49
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:05,61
Hey that will have future value for people in that's the that's the game that I like to play.

50
00:06:05,64 --> 00:06:14,81
I like to play the trading game where I can predict the assets that will increase in value over time I will accumulate

51
00:06:14,81 --> 00:06:16,99
those in then trade them back later.

52
00:06:18,06 --> 00:06:25,53
What I do I see markets fundamentally as a game

53
00:06:25,56 --> 00:06:32,48
but a very important game not a game that is is meant to be nonsensical game

54
00:06:32,48 --> 00:06:40,68
or a trivial game markets tend to be two player games where there is a buyer and there is a seller

55
00:06:40,68 --> 00:06:48,03
or there is an exchange of information and once we understand the rules of this game this market transaction.

56
00:06:48,57 --> 00:06:55,51
Then we can try to optimize what we're trying to do many times people try to optimize their consumption.

57
00:06:56,43 --> 00:07:01,41
According to how much income they have that's a particular consumption game so to speak

58
00:07:01,41 --> 00:07:07,48
and then markets tend to be zero sum games where your gain is my loss

59
00:07:07,51 --> 00:07:12,4
and my gain is your loss in many times markets are set up like that.

60
00:07:14,61 --> 00:07:19,04
It's a very serious game in many cases it's a life or death game markets are

61
00:07:20,06 --> 00:07:24,59
but nevertheless if we think about it in the nomenclature of unknowing men

62
00:07:24,62 --> 00:07:32,12
or mash in many cases it can be modeled is a theory of games

63
00:07:32,34 --> 00:07:37,44
and those theories tell us what our optimal action should be in this market.

64
00:07:45,4 --> 00:07:49,83
A player in only the best sense that there's a negative connotation about a player

65
00:07:49,83 --> 00:07:54,96
but I'm certainly an active market participant and a player in these markets

66
00:07:55,56 --> 00:07:59,26
and I'd like to think of myself as an active participant in.

67
00:08:00,47 --> 00:08:07,24
In the creation of scientific knowledge and we're in a we're in a market constantly you

68
00:08:07,24 --> 00:08:12,04
and I are in a market right now where exchanging information science is also a market.

69
00:08:12,07 --> 00:08:19,43
It's also a game in the sense that there are suppliers and demanders of the scientific knowledge and. In that way.

70
00:08:19,47 --> 00:08:37,75
I consider myself a creator of knowledge and disseminate knowledge. She comes. She. I think that's right.

71
00:08:37,85 --> 00:08:46,85
I think that when markets are poorly constructed. You can think about the financial crisis of the last several years.

72
00:08:47,73 --> 00:08:57,16
There are moments that the market players who have market power tend to change the rules of the game

73
00:08:57,16 --> 00:08:59,6
and we have to be very careful that we don't do that.

74
00:08:59,77 --> 00:09:07,18
Otherwise people become distrustful of the game and distrustful of the market

75
00:09:07,18 --> 00:09:15,65
and that's a first step in the wrong direction because markets are beautiful markets create wealth they create

76
00:09:15,65 --> 00:09:17,67
knowledge they create information

77
00:09:17,67 --> 00:09:25,49
and we have to be careful that people trust market outcomes in people come to markets as active participants who will

78
00:09:25,49 --> 00:09:27,15
be happy about

79
00:09:27,15 --> 00:09:33,71
when someone loses they don't of a sudden change the rules of the game so they become winners I think we have to make

80
00:09:33,71 --> 00:09:43,58
sure as practitioners and as scientists that we don't allow this to happen. This is absolutely.

81
00:09:44,18 --> 00:09:52,16
I think in the end everyone deserves a chance through this market or through this game to succeed. You know as.

82
00:09:53,21 --> 00:09:59,77
As children. We don't choose our parents and if we don't set up the education game.

83
00:10:00,08 --> 00:10:06,52
For the education market in a fair way everyone doesn't have a fair chance to succeed

84
00:10:06,79 --> 00:10:12,03
and I'm fundamentally opposed to people not having a fair chance to succeed in life.

85
00:10:18,93 --> 00:10:19,86
Well

86
00:10:20,94 --> 00:10:31,67
when I first studied economics the very first book that I opened up was written by Paul Samuelson who is one of the most

87
00:10:31,67 --> 00:10:33,84
famous economist of the twentieth century

88
00:10:34,66 --> 00:10:41,28
and Bill Nordhaus who is one of the most famous economists working on Climate Change in

89
00:10:41,39 --> 00:10:53,21
and I was struck by a passage in that book. It said economists cannot run experiments because the world is dirty.

90
00:10:53,9 --> 00:11:00,76
They must therefore sit back like a meteorologist in allow the data to come to them.

91
00:11:01,77 --> 00:11:11,36
In then they can analyze the data using statistical techniques to try to say something causal about the data that's

92
00:11:11,36 --> 00:11:17,81
kind of the way the world was in the late eighty's and early ninety's when I was an undergraduate and graduate student.

93
00:11:19,19 --> 00:11:20,8
And I always thought that was wrong.

94
00:11:21,86 --> 00:11:29,91
Because it's not that I disagreed with them about the world being a very dirty place it is there are multiple markets

95
00:11:29,91 --> 00:11:34,86
there are millions and millions of people millions and millions of firms

96
00:11:34,86 --> 00:11:39,15
and prices in the world is very very Massey So it's not.

97
00:11:39,7 --> 00:11:48,33
It's not like that test tube that the chemist has I think that was their intuition is that the chemist needs a pristine

98
00:11:48,67 --> 00:11:54,07
test tube to run an experiment. So they said look is economist's the world isn't clean.

99
00:11:55,05 --> 00:11:59,92
It's not a sterile test tube so we can't run experiments. I came and I thought much to.

100
00:12:00,01 --> 00:12:09,89
Certainly than that I thought that the sports card markets where I see Konami accent work and I go in

101
00:12:09,98 --> 00:12:16,33
and test economic theory in those markets even though those markets are very dirty they're not clean test tubes.

102
00:12:17,42 --> 00:12:24,89
If I could use randomization Now what I mean by that is I put some people in a treatment group say they get the

103
00:12:24,89 --> 00:12:29,46
cholesterol pill and some people in the control group say they get the sugar pill.

104
00:12:30,18 --> 00:12:36,38
Now all of that dirt is balanced across the treatment of control groups I'm not getting rid of it

105
00:12:36,78 --> 00:12:44,05
but I'm balancing it across treatment control and that allows me to say something causal about the cholesterol pill.

106
00:12:44,34 --> 00:12:48,34
So in a way when I was a graduate student. Absolutely.

107
00:12:48,42 --> 00:12:52,29
I wanted to change the rules of the game I wanted to change the way.

108
00:12:52,39 --> 00:13:02,82
Economists to their empirical work instead of being passive observers have the data come to us and then beat it up

109
00:13:02,82 --> 00:13:11,06
and try to say something cause all I wanted to be an active participant in a market and go in generate my own data.

110
00:13:11,49 --> 00:13:18,87
In generate my own data for a reason to test economic theory and then to change the world about a specific policy

111
00:13:18,87 --> 00:13:25,96
and why do people discriminate Why do people give to charitable causes. Why do inner city schools continue to fail.

112
00:13:26,15 --> 00:13:33,52
These big scientific and social questions are what I want to go after and I want to change the rules of the game

113
00:13:33,52 --> 00:13:46,99
and collect my own data and generate my own data to answer these questions. Thinking. Absolutely.

114
00:13:47,07 --> 00:13:49,98
I mean the the traditional way in which economist

115
00:13:49,98 --> 00:13:57,18
and social scientists more generally think about doing empirical work is they have an idea.

116
00:14:00,38 --> 00:14:07,15
Might be ways in which we can increase people's effort in labor markets.

117
00:14:08,00 --> 00:14:14,22
Then they raced back to their office and they write down a theoretical model and it's a beautiful theoretical model.

118
00:14:15,02 --> 00:14:20,9
In then they say to themselves. How can I test that model many times they don't even test it.

119
00:14:20,92 --> 00:14:24,29
They just write it down and send it out to the world. It's beautiful.

120
00:14:24,65 --> 00:14:28,58
Sometimes they say I want to test the implications of that model.

121
00:14:28,85 --> 00:14:34,83
So what they do is they download mounds and mounds of dad say from the Internet

122
00:14:34,83 --> 00:14:41,05
and then they beat that data up until the Submit since says here's what I say

123
00:14:41,05 --> 00:14:47,9
but they have to impose a lot of statistical assumptions on those data.

124
00:14:48,23 --> 00:14:56,27
To go from a correlation to something that's causal that's the typical way in which scientists have traditionally done

125
00:14:56,27 --> 00:15:02,47
research it down a model go get mounds and mounds of data that somebody else has collected

126
00:15:02,47 --> 00:15:10,36
or the world gives to them beat it up say something about the model. No I do things a little bit differently.

127
00:15:10,49 --> 00:15:18,54
I write down a theory but then I go out in generate data that are meant to test set theory.

128
00:15:18,56 --> 00:15:26,24
So it's a very good fit with the theory itself rather than a misfit rather than put in a square peg where around

129
00:15:26,24 --> 00:15:31,73
when should be which is many times what you're doing when you go out and get the data that the world has given you.

130
00:15:31,82 --> 00:15:41,5
It sounds like science. I think that field experiments have the promise to make.

131
00:15:42,03 --> 00:15:48,43
Economics into what some people would say is a proper science I think for years.

132
00:15:49,15 --> 00:15:57,71
Not only myself but other social scientists have been deemed as soft as a not doing real science.

133
00:16:00,29 --> 00:16:06,89
I think it's fair to say that with field experiments economists now have their full fledged scientific cards.

134
00:16:08,95 --> 00:16:14,89
There are absolutely. Absolutely.

135
00:16:23,48 --> 00:16:35,76
Yeah I think on the one hand behavioral economics might be thought of as a great marketing tool because for decades.

136
00:16:35,91 --> 00:16:44,31
Economists have been interested in behavioral economics you can go all the way back to Adam Smith who talked about.

137
00:16:45,28 --> 00:16:49,79
The moral Hector on the shoulder and doing the right thing.

138
00:16:50,71 --> 00:16:55,84
People don't get that from his most popular book but he has a second book that is very behavioral.

139
00:16:56,58 --> 00:17:02,93
You can go all the way through the twentieth century you had John Maynard Keynes who's very behavioral you had Gary

140
00:17:02,93 --> 00:17:10,09
Becker one of my heroes at the University of Chicago who was very behavioral he was talking about why people

141
00:17:10,09 --> 00:17:11,1
discriminate.

142
00:17:11,93 --> 00:17:14,56
Why do people have Ultra Stick preferences

143
00:17:15,23 --> 00:17:24,73
but then there was this explosion with the work of Danny condom in in Amos Tversky in the seventy's in Dick Thaler in

144
00:17:24,73 --> 00:17:32,91
the eighty's in economics where. We didn't need to invent behavioral economics again because after these pioneers.

145
00:17:32,96 --> 00:17:39,4
Everyone knew what behavioral economics was what which essentially is now to add in psychology

146
00:17:39,4 --> 00:17:43,22
or insights from another discipline into the economic model.

147
00:17:43,79 --> 00:17:46,56
I think you could view it is

148
00:17:47,47 --> 00:17:56,98
and in some humanity to the economics man which I think is right in the moment that you add behavioral economics

149
00:17:56,98 --> 00:17:59,95
or psychology or or let's just say.

150
00:18:00,04 --> 00:18:08,53
Common sense to the economics man we can understand her a little bit more than we could with with the straight sterile

151
00:18:08,53 --> 00:18:17,32
model of neoclassical economics because you know that's right.

152
00:18:17,38 --> 00:18:26,19
I think that was a mistake for many years and in which many people did separate the model from the person and.

153
00:18:26,73 --> 00:18:38,22
People became not very interested in questions about why people did things I think the moment you start to economic

154
00:18:38,22 --> 00:18:41,2
science many times people simply want to measure.

155
00:18:41,44 --> 00:18:49,94
So they measure how much discrimination there is on a market where they measure. What is what is the.

156
00:18:50,28 --> 00:18:55,66
Gender pay gap or the difference between men and women in markets

157
00:18:55,66 --> 00:19:03,24
and then they stop where I think behavioral economics and field experiments allows you to go to the next level

158
00:19:03,24 --> 00:19:06,84
and say why do people discriminate.

159
00:19:06,93 --> 00:19:10,68
Why do women earn less money than men in markets

160
00:19:10,68 --> 00:19:18,69
and it's only after we answer the why's can we first of all know what model is at work and secondly.

161
00:19:19,53 --> 00:19:28,12
We can then put forward public policies to combat the injustices that are done in the world. Only after we know why.

162
00:19:28,37 --> 00:19:42,26
I think by doing field experiments it's the best possible way to not only measure.

163
00:19:42,79 --> 00:19:52,14
For example does discrimination exist in a market but also to distinguish wide as discrimination occur in the market.

164
00:19:52,15 --> 00:19:59,35
I can think of no other tool. That is better than running a field experiment to figure out why.

165
00:20:00,2 --> 00:20:08,15
People are doing what they're doing. You know well let's talk a little bit about that.

166
00:20:08,3 --> 00:20:15,04
So let's let's use the example of discrimination. So in the late one nine hundred fifty S.

167
00:20:15,04 --> 00:20:22,01
An economist named Gary Bakker at the University of Chicago did a dissertation on the economics of discrimination

168
00:20:22,01 --> 00:20:30,25
and his model was based on the simple premise that some people have a preference for discrimination

169
00:20:30,25 --> 00:20:37,04
and what that means is they derive satisfaction of harming another group.

170
00:20:37,25 --> 00:20:41,4
So for example they might not like women or they might not like man

171
00:20:41,4 --> 00:20:44,06
or they might not like old gray haired people like me

172
00:20:44,06 --> 00:20:54,01
or they might not like people of certain races so they treat them poorly they don't hire them for jobs they give them

173
00:20:54,01 --> 00:20:57,97
higher price quotes in used car markets for example

174
00:20:57,97 --> 00:21:02,31
and his model was basically one of people had a taste for discrimination.

175
00:21:02,84 --> 00:21:11,38
So that's one kind of discrimination that's of course abysmal we don't want that another kind of discrimination is what

176
00:21:11,38 --> 00:21:18,49
put goo in all the economist called Third Degree price discrimination in what that was.

177
00:21:19,67 --> 00:21:27,81
Was People discriminate in markets. Not because they dislike the other person but because they want to make more money.

178
00:21:28,08 --> 00:21:36,17
So for example. I might charge women more money in a market because I know they don't like to bargain.

179
00:21:36,41 --> 00:21:41,22
It's not that I dislike women. I just like money and I want to make money for myself.

180
00:21:41,57 --> 00:21:46,94
So now these two theories are very different on the one hand you have backer who says.

181
00:21:47,78 --> 00:21:55,88
People discriminate because they want to cater their prejudice in fact they will give up money to harm another group

182
00:21:55,88 --> 00:22:05,4
and you have another theory that says whoa whoa whoa. Wait a moment people discriminate been effort to make more money.

183
00:22:06,93 --> 00:22:13,88
Very different very different implications in the public policy is to take on these two are very different.

184
00:22:14,26 --> 00:22:18,69
You can think of quotas and the like over here to take on better type discrimination.

185
00:22:19,1 --> 00:22:28,42
Now with poor good type discrimination can take of education and giving people the right tools and bargaining in or

186
00:22:28,47 --> 00:22:34,35
or in information or education to take on that two very different types of discrimination in till we know.

187
00:22:35,02 --> 00:22:42,76
What is happening in markets we cannot even begin to put forward a public policy to take on those bits of

188
00:22:42,76 --> 00:22:49,56
discrimination and that's why field experiments are so important because they tell us the whys whos right back

189
00:22:49,56 --> 00:22:54,67
or most of my data would suggest be good is right. But.

190
00:22:55,65 --> 00:23:23,23
Nevertheless now we know and we can take that on with public policies. Yeah. Let me ask you have salute Lisa this this.

191
00:23:23,91 --> 00:23:27,38
This research we should kind of back ourselves up and ask.

192
00:23:29,23 --> 00:23:38,91
Let's look at the data from labor markets and compare men and women in when we do that all around the globe.

193
00:23:39,44 --> 00:23:46,02
You have men making in say between ten and forty percent more than women.

194
00:23:46,96 --> 00:23:54,3
And then you start to control for things like occupation. Human capital.

195
00:23:54,95 --> 00:23:59,99
Time out of the labor force and you still have a significant difference say now.

196
00:24:00,01 --> 00:24:07,12
It's five to fifteen percent and then we must ask ourselves what is causing that difference.

197
00:24:07,5 --> 00:24:11,7
And what can we do to get rid of that difference. Now.

198
00:24:12,37 --> 00:24:18,57
There were some researchers called early Guinea's E N L though Rusty Keeney and Marian need early

199
00:24:18,57 --> 00:24:26,43
and Lisa Vester the one who started to do lab experiments to explore what could underlie these differences

200
00:24:26,48 --> 00:24:36,84
and they were beginning to find that men were more competitive than women. So this is where I step in ask.

201
00:24:37,9 --> 00:24:44,88
And we generalize those insights into the field and explore what are the implications.

202
00:24:45,68 --> 00:24:50,7
In the field in real markets for this difference in preferences.

203
00:24:51,48 --> 00:25:01,45
OK so where I started was I said why do men and women have different preferences for being competitive.

204
00:25:03,52 --> 00:25:07,46
So I looked all around the globe and this is where the early going.

205
00:25:07,53 --> 00:25:09,63
Izzie and cannot in my two co-authors

206
00:25:09,63 --> 00:25:19,24
and we said can we find two societies that are diametrically opposed in terms of the power that the woman has in the

207
00:25:19,24 --> 00:25:22,79
household and in the society. And we came pretty close.

208
00:25:23,12 --> 00:25:29,53
We found one very patriarchal society in Tanzania called the Messiah tribe.

209
00:25:30,14 --> 00:25:36,58
And under close to the other end of the spectrum was a major lineal society called the Cassy society

210
00:25:36,58 --> 00:25:44,96
and what we did is we simply went out to those two societies and took the simple experiments from the lab

211
00:25:44,96 --> 00:25:50,58
and tried to replicate those in the field and our first result is.

212
00:25:51,52 --> 00:25:58,74
The differences across the societies were really enormous when you talk to people in the Messiah tribe in Tanzania.

213
00:26:00,52 --> 00:26:04,38
In you ask a messiah man. What is your wealth.

214
00:26:04,69 --> 00:26:10,86
What he'll tell you is I have fourteen head of cattle three donkey two sheep and four wives.

215
00:26:11,76 --> 00:26:18,47
And he says if I want another wife I have to trade seven head of cattle because that's a current price.

216
00:26:19,39 --> 00:26:27,68
While only right that women have as their husband has to visit them for fifteen minutes every morning in their tent.

217
00:26:28,62 --> 00:26:36,26
That's the rights that women have really really a terrible society for with no one near the other end of the spectrum

218
00:26:36,29 --> 00:26:37,68
are the Cassie's who.

219
00:26:39,25 --> 00:26:48,05
When you when you jump in a cab from the airport and go out to the villages in in red outside a show long.

220
00:26:48,42 --> 00:26:56,06
You see these billboards that they keep saying the same thing in the taxi cab driver after you ask the taxi cab driver

221
00:26:56,06 --> 00:27:03,63
what. What do these billboards say he says of. It's those men again they're asking for equal rights.

222
00:27:04,06 --> 00:27:11,42
So you have close to the other side of society where if you knock on the door of a Cassie a met the man will answer

223
00:27:11,42 --> 00:27:15,35
and he will take you back to the woman of the house.

224
00:27:15,99 --> 00:27:22,07
And then you will talk to the woman about the issues of the day the woman who will make market decisions

225
00:27:22,07 --> 00:27:23,92
and will make decisions for the family.

226
00:27:25,38 --> 00:27:32,83
You know it's gotten to the point where many Cassy men will say something like we're sick of playing the role of

227
00:27:32,89 --> 00:27:34,74
breeding bulls and babysitters.

228
00:27:35,06 --> 00:27:37,63
So these are these are very different societies

229
00:27:38,09 --> 00:27:46,4
and what we do is we run the simple experiments in these two societies in what we find is that the Tanzanians are a lot

230
00:27:46,4 --> 00:27:52,86
like us in the U.S. and In Western Europe the men compete a lot more than the women compete.

231
00:27:54,07 --> 00:27:59,98
Now when we go to the Cassie's what happens is that reverses the Cassy women compete.

232
00:28:00,01 --> 00:28:06,81
Eat like our man and the Cassie man compete roughly about like our women.

233
00:28:07,26 --> 00:28:11,01
So this gives you a sense it's a beginning first step.

234
00:28:11,05 --> 00:28:13,58
It's certainly not the final word

235
00:28:13,58 --> 00:28:21,45
but it's a beginning first step to get to the point of what causes these differences and preferences

236
00:28:21,45 --> 00:28:26,11
and I think this literature in our study is point to the power of socialization.

237
00:28:27,45 --> 00:28:31,06
And when we raise our little boys

238
00:28:31,06 --> 00:28:40,06
and girls what subtle words that we say to them subtle gifts that we give them have lasting impacts into the future.

239
00:28:40,41 --> 00:28:44,21
I can still remember. When I was in second or third grade.

240
00:28:44,94 --> 00:28:46,42
I was feeling ill one day

241
00:28:46,42 --> 00:28:53,84
and I wasn't performing in my physical education class in my gym class I wasn't doing as well is what I usually do.

242
00:28:53,97 --> 00:29:00,24
Do you know what the teacher yells out to me Hey John. Hey John.

243
00:29:00,26 --> 00:29:03,79
Quit playing like a sissy you're playing like a girl today.

244
00:29:04,7 --> 00:29:10,14
He had in his mind that girl should play a certain way in boys should play a certain way

245
00:29:10,14 --> 00:29:16,64
and that's exactly how we're typically socialized and I think that importantly determines our long run outcomes.

246
00:29:16,86 --> 00:29:23,65
Now our next step in this research agenda was to create a firm and hire workers

247
00:29:23,65 --> 00:29:32,2
and actually put out ads across United States to hire IT Ministry of assistance this is work with Andres labor and

248
00:29:32,2 --> 00:29:38,01
and what we explored is if we change the incentive scheme.

249
00:29:38,68 --> 00:29:47,31
From one where we tell people wages are negotiable to another one where we have the exact same ad.

250
00:29:47,79 --> 00:29:52,56
But we don't say wages are negotiable. And then we look at whether men and women.

251
00:29:52,58 --> 00:30:01,1
First of all apply in then whether they negotiate and what we find is that when we say Wade. Edges are negotiable.

252
00:30:01,96 --> 00:30:11,36
Many many women apply and they negotiate as much as men. Now when we leave that sentence out of the job description.

253
00:30:12,66 --> 00:30:19,79
What happens is women shy away from applying and they shy away from negotiating

254
00:30:20,1 --> 00:30:26,78
and in fact the men negotiate a lot more than the women when that aspect is ambiguous

255
00:30:26,87 --> 00:30:29,78
and what that tells us is that in these M.

256
00:30:29,78 --> 00:30:38,42
Big us who vegs settings women are taught to shy away from asking because they don't know if it's appropriate where men

257
00:30:38,66 --> 00:30:45,68
in our experiment was actually the low quality men who came forward in the bargain the most so men are taught to be

258
00:30:45,68 --> 00:30:52,64
aggressive as boys and go after what you deserve. So then they do it in markets and you have these inequities.

259
00:30:53,52 --> 00:30:59,38
But I think that's right.

260
00:30:59,48 --> 00:31:08,44
When you look at the way our economy is set up the the highest pain jobs are the ones that are the most competitive.

261
00:31:08,74 --> 00:31:14,99
They're the ones that you build your way up the pyramid in then when you're at the top.

262
00:31:15,02 --> 00:31:20,21
It's highly competitive because your firm is competing against another firm that is altered competitive

263
00:31:20,21 --> 00:31:27,44
and the world is a place of competition but my argument is that. If we can set up.

264
00:31:28,27 --> 00:31:36,62
The wage schemes in the rules of the game in a way in which we recognize that society is handicapped in certain types

265
00:31:36,62 --> 00:31:39,98
of people. If we set up the rules of the game at the entry level.

266
00:31:40,96 --> 00:31:46,48
This can systematically affect where these two types of people go in the long run and market.

267
00:31:51,13 --> 00:31:59,88
It's look many things are extremely competitive The question is should we set up our wages in our house.

268
00:32:00,01 --> 00:32:02,00
We pay people in a competitive way.

269
00:32:02,45 --> 00:32:10,25
Or are there ways in which we can set up wage contracts that get people to perform at their highest levels

270
00:32:10,91 --> 00:32:12,67
but they're not cutthroat wages.

271
00:32:13,08 --> 00:32:16,51
You see and and I don't think is economists

272
00:32:16,51 --> 00:32:24,21
or policy makers we have thought hard about setting up the rules of the game in a way that will give everyone a fair

273
00:32:24,21 --> 00:32:27,57
chance but will still lead to really good outcomes.

274
00:32:28,26 --> 00:32:35,01
Because right now you have a lot of lost human talent because women shy away from the set ins

275
00:32:35,01 --> 00:32:42,07
or a lot of women who are very very talented who shy away from settings that are too competitive so we're essentially

276
00:32:42,07 --> 00:32:48,22
wasting their human capital because of the manner in which our wage contracts are set up that's what I'm saying.

277
00:32:50,4 --> 00:32:51,34
I think something can be done.

278
00:32:51,49 --> 00:32:57,06
One example is my study that I just talked about where if we're very clear about the rules of the game

279
00:32:57,06 --> 00:33:01,66
and how people should negotiate they will then negotiate as hard is they should

280
00:33:01,66 --> 00:33:06,29
and they will start out with wages that are much more equal than they otherwise would be.

281
00:33:07,29 --> 00:33:21,32
Women should just negotiate say that you know some of the implications from our studies when we go overseas

282
00:33:21,32 --> 00:33:34,09
and look at behavior in major lineal societies what you have is women are much gentle or with the resources.

283
00:33:34,52 --> 00:33:36,18
We've been given here on Earth.

284
00:33:36,77 --> 00:33:46,53
For example when we look at men and women farm in a run in in Iran Chalong what you see is that

285
00:33:46,53 --> 00:33:57,24
when women have the choices about what crops to plant and how to rotate their crops they tend to be much kinder

286
00:33:57,24 --> 00:34:06,2
and gentler to the soil. Than what. The men will be so in this way you have some indications that on some dimensions.

287
00:34:07,18 --> 00:34:14,35
We would be much better off having the gentle touch of a woman. Absolutely. If.

288
00:34:15,41 --> 00:34:22,42
I think they are playing very different games I think men are playing name a much shorter run game over there in women

289
00:34:22,42 --> 00:34:31,22
are playing in the long run game that we need to continue to that say nurture this land

290
00:34:31,34 --> 00:34:39,00
and it's going to be ours for a long time in we want to live in a symbiotic way where the man might just discount the

291
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:45,6
future a little bit more than women and they're playing a different fundamental market game in

292
00:34:45,63 --> 00:35:06,14
and in this case farming game than women are. Yes that's right that's right. That's right.

293
00:35:06,21 --> 00:35:09,39
So my work in education started about a decade ago.

294
00:35:09,61 --> 00:35:18,98
There's a local community around Chicago called Chicago Heights and they came to me with a plea.

295
00:35:19,44 --> 00:35:25,39
They had read about some of my work in the New York Times magazine on charitable giving.

296
00:35:25,59 --> 00:35:30,58
So I work a little bit on the economics of charity why people give to charitable causes

297
00:35:30,58 --> 00:35:36,74
and they wondered if I could come into their school district and help them

298
00:35:36,74 --> 00:35:43,87
and I visited the school district a few days later and what I found was.

299
00:35:45,39 --> 00:35:49,64
A school district that was in very difficult shape.

300
00:35:50,16 --> 00:35:59,9
They were they had two high schools and they had about a thousand kids entering the ninth grade each year and all.

301
00:36:00,01 --> 00:36:04,51
The About four hundred seventy of them were graduating from high school.

302
00:36:05,34 --> 00:36:10,86
So you had this community that was largely in trouble with its public education.

303
00:36:12,04 --> 00:36:20,12
So we began to use field experiments to try to learn about why that inner city school was failing.

304
00:36:20,55 --> 00:36:27,74
And in the last ten years. I have been thinking hard about using Chicago Heights is my laboratory.

305
00:36:28,77 --> 00:36:35,41
And in this sense it's a field experimental laboratory that is meant first of all to test economic theory.

306
00:36:35,75 --> 00:36:39,71
So we have different theories about what's called the Education production function.

307
00:36:40,63 --> 00:36:49,61
You know how do the inputs such as children's effort parents Safford in teacher effort map into outcomes that we care

308
00:36:49,61 --> 00:37:01,38
about outcomes like finishing high school outcomes like going to college outcomes like it in a high paying job outcomes

309
00:37:01,38 --> 00:37:06,47
like. Being a better citizen. In our global community.

310
00:37:07,21 --> 00:37:13,9
So we started thinking hard about how those inputs affected the outputs that we cared about

311
00:37:14,7 --> 00:37:17,46
and then also how can we change those inputs.

312
00:37:18,09 --> 00:37:22,74
How can we fundamentally change the effort levels of parents

313
00:37:22,9 --> 00:37:33,61
or how can we fundamentally change the effort levels of children or or teachers or administrators. Absolutely.

314
00:37:33,68 --> 00:37:39,00
So this is markets now again. Now when I started this research.

315
00:37:39,1 --> 00:37:45,78
I thought hard about what do we know in public education because in the US We've been at public education for over one

316
00:37:45,78 --> 00:37:52,2
hundred years you should say we should know a lot but I think public education got caught in this rut.

317
00:37:52,79 --> 00:37:59,63
Whereby they more or less took this Mark Twain quote is once you have.

318
00:38:00,34 --> 00:38:06,17
Ignorance and confidence then success is insured so I think people were ignorant

319
00:38:06,17 --> 00:38:08,65
and confident that they knew what was happening.

320
00:38:09,02 --> 00:38:14,17
And then for years here in the States especially our public education system was broken

321
00:38:15,22 --> 00:38:23,97
and I think it's fundamentally because we use our classrooms to simply teach our kids.

322
00:38:24,42 --> 00:38:29,57
We don't use our classrooms to teach our kids and teach ourselves what works and why.

323
00:38:30,14 --> 00:38:36,97
And I think we need to change that mentality because this is life or death. Much like medicines.

324
00:38:37,52 --> 00:38:46,53
You know in the medical community we figure out which drugs work by testing them by using science in testing whether a

325
00:38:46,53 --> 00:38:53,24
heart medication works better than another heart medication better than the control group which receives a sugar pill.

326
00:38:53,86 --> 00:38:59,53
I fundamentally don't understand why we don't take that mentality to the classroom

327
00:38:59,53 --> 00:39:09,08
and all around the world we should be using our classrooms as laboratories laboratories of innovation to figure out

328
00:39:09,08 --> 00:39:16,24
what works. Why does it work and how can we make the world a better place through education because fundamentally.

329
00:39:16,97 --> 00:39:22,00
You know it is I said before we don't choose parents.

330
00:39:22,18 --> 00:39:29,53
We don't choose a community in which we're born into and if we don't give these kids in equal chance to succeed.

331
00:39:30,21 --> 00:39:36,79
We are leaving so much human potential on the table. We've talked a lot about equity here.

332
00:39:37,22 --> 00:39:43,48
Equity is giving everyone a fair chance in life and that's important but you can also talk about efficiency.

333
00:39:43,58 --> 00:39:46,91
I don't think we've wasted.

334
00:39:47,73 --> 00:39:51,07
This much human potential since the Dark Ages

335
00:39:51,07 --> 00:39:58,92
when you look at our technology that we have in place around the world in you look at all of the human potential that

336
00:39:58,92 --> 00:40:03,89
we're wasting. Because kids are not receiving proper education. That's a crime.

337
00:40:04,34 --> 00:40:05,18
That's a real crime

338
00:40:05,18 --> 00:40:11,56
and it's because we have not been serious about using field experiments in the classroom to learn about what works

339
00:40:11,56 --> 00:40:14,97
and why. So what kind of the.

340
00:40:16,29 --> 00:40:22,64
Yes So in Chicago Heights in the last decade we've been running in a number of field experiments

341
00:40:22,64 --> 00:40:27,00
and let me tell you about one with teachers so. For decades.

342
00:40:27,48 --> 00:40:33,7
People have argued about whether teachers should be paid for their performance so.

343
00:40:35,02 --> 00:40:41,21
Some people say if a teacher does a really good job with her students.

344
00:40:41,26 --> 00:40:48,59
Then she should get paid a bonus but there are people say. No no no we don't want to add money.

345
00:40:49,11 --> 00:40:57,45
To this equation because great teachers. Don't value money they value teaching per se.

346
00:40:57,5 --> 00:41:01,07
So some people have gone out

347
00:41:01,07 --> 00:41:08,54
and they've explored a typical way in which to pay a teacher a bonus what they've said is in September.

348
00:41:08,82 --> 00:41:11,91
They tell teachers that if you do a good job.

349
00:41:12,71 --> 00:41:18,75
You will be paid a bonus next June at the end of the school year and by and large they haven't really found.

350
00:41:19,54 --> 00:41:23,15
Very promising results and they have been small

351
00:41:23,15 --> 00:41:29,17
and in consequential So that's a place where we started we said Can we start there

352
00:41:29,17 --> 00:41:34,86
and use behavioral economics to make the incentive better.

353
00:41:35,1 --> 00:41:43,97
So our idea was what if we took a group of teachers in in September we actually gave them the bonus upfront

354
00:41:43,97 --> 00:41:45,38
and told them.

355
00:41:46,07 --> 00:41:54,38
We will take the bonus away from you in less your students achieve if your students achieve you can keep the bonus if

356
00:41:54,38 --> 00:41:59,61
they don't achieve. We will take it away from you and what happens is that incentive scheme.

357
00:42:00,35 --> 00:42:11,45
Works in a brilliant way is an example if your child was placed in the classroom of a teacher who received that claw

358
00:42:11,45 --> 00:42:16,53
back incentive scheme. They their test scores.

359
00:42:16,65 --> 00:42:24,51
Actually it Vance by about what's called Point two standard deviations above the control group which turned out to be

360
00:42:24,54 --> 00:42:27,38
several months of education.

361
00:42:27,41 --> 00:42:36,52
So you're basically getting several months of extra education because the teacher is in this claw back incentive scheme.

362
00:42:36,59 --> 00:42:40,31
Now you might ask yourself why does that club back incentive scheme work.

363
00:42:41,45 --> 00:42:47,21
We can go back to the days of Dan economy and Amos to versity they wrote about something called loss aversion

364
00:42:47,77 --> 00:42:55,9
and what that means is that people value losses much more than they value comparable gains.

365
00:42:56,66 --> 00:43:03,33
So a dollar loss is felt much more acutely than a dollar again. So we're leveraging that insight if you use it.

366
00:43:03,33 --> 00:43:10,84
Introspection and say. I'm I like that many of us are like that we really do not like losses.

367
00:43:12,43 --> 00:43:22,11
So can we leverage that is a public policy tool we found we can we found that teachers will work a lot harder if you

368
00:43:22,11 --> 00:43:25,9
leverage loss aversion. Now we've done this. Also in other venues too.

369
00:43:26,25 --> 00:43:34,58
We've gone to China and we've looked at Chinese manufacturing workers in we've used the exact same incentive scheme.

370
00:43:34,85 --> 00:43:41,39
We've said at the beginning of the week. Here's a bonus. And if you work hard on Friday.

371
00:43:41,41 --> 00:43:49,57
You can keep that bonus in we compare that to the idea that work hard all week will give you a bonus on Friday loss

372
00:43:49,57 --> 00:43:51,25
aversion one works a lot better

373
00:43:51,25 --> 00:43:59,87
and in fact we did the one in China over a six month period over all six months the manufacturing workers worked hard.

374
00:44:00,07 --> 00:44:00,32
Or

375
00:44:00,46 --> 00:44:06,79
when they were getting the bonus Up front this is a useful way to leverage behavioral economics to make the world a better

376
00:44:06,79 --> 00:44:11,98
place. Yes We actually did the same with students as well.

377
00:44:12,34 --> 00:44:19,88
So you might ask yourself how can I make my child work hard for experiments with students is the morning of the test

378
00:44:19,88 --> 00:44:23,41
when they enter the room where they take the test. We announce to them.

379
00:44:23,9 --> 00:44:32,4
Here's twenty dollars if you perform better than you did on your last test you can keep the twenty dollars if you don't

380
00:44:32,4 --> 00:44:33,24
perform better.

381
00:44:33,27 --> 00:44:35,13
We will take the twenty dollars away

382
00:44:35,73 --> 00:44:42,85
and what happens is those students significantly increase their test scores in an amount that you cannot even imagine

383
00:44:43,07 --> 00:44:47,54
compared to people who we tell them we will give you twenty dollars if you perform well.

384
00:44:48,21 --> 00:44:52,68
Those people perform much worse than people who you give the twenty dollars to.

385
00:44:54,76 --> 00:44:58,67
We did we then saw the teacher results and we said.

386
00:44:58,72 --> 00:45:02,45
Will that work with students we did a little bit differently with students.

387
00:45:03,31 --> 00:45:09,09
We had them and to the test room and then after they entered the test room.

388
00:45:09,12 --> 00:45:12,73
We announced our incentives so they did not have time to prepare.

389
00:45:13,13 --> 00:45:20,49
We were just looking at the morning of the test can we give them incentives in leverage loss aversion

390
00:45:20,56 --> 00:45:23,53
and get them to try harder and perform better on the test.

391
00:45:23,7 --> 00:45:27,63
So what we did is we gave a big group of students twenty dollars

392
00:45:27,66 --> 00:45:34,77
and said If you perform better than you did on the last test you can keep the twenty dollars in we compared their test

393
00:45:34,77 --> 00:45:40,78
scores to people who we said if you improve on your test score from last time you will receive twenty dollars.

394
00:45:41,78 --> 00:45:42,58
What happens is

395
00:45:42,58 --> 00:45:50,14
when you give students twenty dollars they perform much much better than if you tell them you'll receive twenty dollars

396
00:45:50,14 --> 00:45:50,87
in the future.

397
00:45:51,33 --> 00:45:56,41
That's of I think it's a very important insight about what our task measure when you

398
00:45:56,57 --> 00:45:59,99
when you look at these standardized tests they're not only measuring in name.

399
00:46:00,01 --> 00:46:08,63
Debility they're also measuring in effort. Oh or how hard students try on these tests. Why.

400
00:46:12,71 --> 00:46:21,21
Yeah I think the underlying reason why loss aversion works is because people develop a deep pain

401
00:46:21,84 --> 00:46:25,42
or a distaste for something that they have to give up.

402
00:46:25,45 --> 00:46:30,25
So my own research that started back in two thousand and three in the sports card market.

403
00:46:30,48 --> 00:46:35,23
I tried to explore why do people not like to trade.

404
00:46:35,61 --> 00:46:43,38
Why do people not like to give something up in what I found back then was it looked like it was a pain of giving

405
00:46:43,38 --> 00:46:49,29
something up. That's why people did not like to give up or trade what they owned.

406
00:46:49,97 --> 00:46:56,17
So now recently what we've done is we've placed people in F. M.R.I.

407
00:46:56,17 --> 00:46:58,92
Tubes and we've looked at their brain activity

408
00:46:58,92 --> 00:47:06,44
and we've explored really inexperienced people in what their brain activity looks like compared to people who have a

409
00:47:06,44 --> 00:47:10,04
lot of experience in trading in people who trade a lot.

410
00:47:10,09 --> 00:47:17,86
They tend to code trades in a different part of the brain than people who are inexperienced traders in particular the

411
00:47:17,86 --> 00:47:32,14
people who are experienced Do not go to the last part of the brain in people who are inexperienced go to the last part.

412
00:47:24,75 --> 00:47:32,14
when they have to give something up. So it's sort of uncovers through the market and through F. M.R.I.

413
00:47:33,07 --> 00:47:46,01
Or imaging of the brain. It tells you why people when they gain experience why they can trademark. It. Absolutely.

414
00:47:46,07 --> 00:47:51,92
I think the major reason why markets work is because people trade.

415
00:47:52,05 --> 00:47:59,91
You have people who trade by definition the seller gains in the buyer gains through a trade.

416
00:48:00,74 --> 00:48:10,88
So if we can contemplate why there's a lack of trading and markets we can figure out why doesn't the market.

417
00:48:10,89 --> 00:48:16,46
Work the way it should we can then design incentives to get people to trade more in markets.

418
00:48:16,6 --> 00:48:20,3
What we find is that there is not enough trade in in markets

419
00:48:20,3 --> 00:48:23,63
or the market gains are smaller than they should be because of loss aversion.

420
00:48:23,98 --> 00:48:28,8
So what can we do to make the market function more appropriately.

421
00:48:28,96 --> 00:48:34,13
My argument is you have to give them a sense of overcoming loss aversion

422
00:48:34,13 --> 00:48:40,14
and that's through market experience so you have to give them trades and give them. Let's say free trade.

423
00:48:40,16 --> 00:48:45,41
So to speak and once people trade in trade in trade. They don't have loss of us preferences anymore.

424
00:48:45,71 --> 00:48:49,05
That's how we can use it to make markets better. Yes.

425
00:48:50,49 --> 00:48:55,15
I think if we somehow change the rules to make people want to trade more

426
00:48:55,15 --> 00:49:00,00
when they're first enter a market the market can be more efficient in the end that's right.
