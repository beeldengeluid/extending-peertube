1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,26
Interviewer:  [Prakhaim 00:00:00] what sparked your curiosity for pre-Arabic languages?

2
00:00:05,26 --> 00:00:06,93
Prakhaim: You mean pre-Arabic?

3
00:00:06,93 --> 00:00:07,93
Interviewer: Yeah.

4
00:00:07,93 --> 00:00:20,09
Prakhaim: Well, when I attended the university in 1983, I started studying Arabistic, Arabic Studies.

5
00:00:23,02 --> 00:00:28,74
I attended courses in the Arabic morphology, syntax,

6
00:00:28,74 --> 00:00:40,2
and I found out that most of the linguistic phenomena couldn't be explained by the normal methodology which we follow

7
00:00:40,2 --> 00:00:43,28
in Arabic Studies usually, the traditional Arabic Studies.

8
00:00:45,16 --> 00:00:52,84
Which, in fact, in the future, after I got my BA in Arabistic at Yarmouk University in 1987,

9
00:00:52,84 --> 00:00:58,82
I attended a Master program in Epigraphy.

10
00:01:00,85 --> 00:01:11,59
Epigraphy is the study of ancient inscriptions in general, and whether they are incised on rock, or cast in metal

11
00:01:11,59 --> 00:01:18,29
or on wood, really, there are many surfaces.

12
00:01:18,29 --> 00:01:27,72
We can talk about many surfaces where ancient inscriptions are written.	In fact, this study, I mean,

13
00:01:28,15 --> 00:01:34,05
studying epigraphy at Yarmouk University, the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology,

14
00:01:34,05 --> 00:01:43,22
paved my way to understand more about the prehistory of Arabic in general.

15
00:01:43,22 --> 00:01:51,37
Also, it gives me the opportunity to discover more about the cultural history of Arabian Peninsula before Islam,

16
00:01:51,37 --> 00:02:02,81
because through the inscriptions we discover usually facts related to the religious beliefs in Arabia,

17
00:02:03,68 --> 00:02:09,11
as well as historical facts that are not attested in the Arabic sources or in the Arabic tradition.

18
00:02:11,17 --> 00:02:13,24
What I mean, that studying Arabic

19
00:02:13,65 --> 00:02:26,66
and Arabic culture in general would not yield to useful conclusions without studying the ancient Arabian languages in

20
00:02:26,66 --> 00:02:27,47
general.

21
00:02:27,71 --> 00:02:32,96
I mean, every students who attends, who would like to study Arabic and Arabian culture,

22
00:02:33,83 --> 00:02:41,42
should start maybe from the 10th Century BC to have a wide understanding

23
00:02:41,42 --> 00:02:49,88
and a deep understanding about the Arabian Peninsula and its history, its religions, and languages.

24
00:02:49,88 --> 00:02:58,74
Interviewer: You started studying that? Was it a new study? Were you the first or were you one of the first to do that?

25
00:02:58,74 --> 00:02:59,85
Prakhaim: Well, yes.

26
00:03:03,63 --> 00:03:06,09
In fact, my group in fact, in 1987,

27
00:03:06,09 --> 00:03:16,64
were the second group which attended the MA in Epigraphy at the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology,

28
00:03:17,22 --> 00:03:28,01
and we are now more than 30 professors spread over Jordan and worldwide.

29
00:03:28,33 --> 00:03:42,03
This gave us, of course, an impulse to work on further to discover our cultural heritage, our linguistic

30
00:03:42,03 --> 00:03:46,96
and cultural heritage in general. In fact, I'm okay.

31
00:03:47,78 --> 00:03:55,03
I’m at Yarmouk University now, where I studied before, but my stay in Germany, in fact,

32
00:03:55,51 --> 00:04:05,45
I invested my stay in Germany to go in depth in this study.

33
00:04:06,82 --> 00:04:17,14
I tried my best, through German language, to discover more and more about the Arabian culture

34
00:04:17,14 --> 00:04:27,33
and the Arabian cultural history, in addition to Levantine, and also the Horn of Africa.

35
00:04:27,33 --> 00:04:34,8
I'm also interested in the relationship between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa,

36
00:04:34,8 --> 00:04:49,99
in addition to a wide historical spectrum covered by my study, either during my MA period and PhD period in Germany.

37
00:04:49,99 --> 00:04:55,26
Interviewer: In the German period, you discovered, or you discovered probably before,

38
00:04:55,26 --> 00:04:59,63
but what I like in your German period, what you describe is how you somehow, through language,

39
00:05:00,14 --> 00:05:06,6
learning the German language, discovered more and more of the German soul, the German culture, the German-

40
00:05:06,6 --> 00:05:13,65
Prakhaim: Yeah, of course. I mean, learning German was of great importance for me.

41
00:05:13,65 --> 00:05:21,7
It paved the way to understand literature written in German in general, and, as you know, German,

42
00:05:21,7 --> 00:05:29,75
or any language you learn, is kind of a key. It's a key to the culture itself.

43
00:05:29,98 --> 00:05:33,83
Not only to literature, but also to the people.

44
00:05:33,83 --> 00:05:37,89
I mean, if you understand the language, if you can deal with the language,

45
00:05:38,76 --> 00:05:42,06
it means that you can discover the culture as well.

46
00:05:42,06 --> 00:05:45,19
Interviewer: German is of course a living language.

47
00:05:45,86 --> 00:05:49,05
It's a language that's been spoken by lots of people in Germany and abroad.

48
00:05:49,77 --> 00:05:54,43
You went on in studying languages that are pre-Islamic?

49
00:05:54,43 --> 00:05:58,25
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact … Well, yes.

50
00:06:00,03 --> 00:06:09,55
If you know the system of a certain language, then it will be easy for you to learn other languages.

51
00:06:10,12 --> 00:06:17,12
I talk now about the grammar of a language. I'm not talking about the script.

52
00:06:19,2 --> 00:06:23,8
Yes, I had the background how to deal with languages in German.

53
00:06:25,29 --> 00:06:35,96
That's why it was for me maybe easy to learn German, and also to deal with it and to write a lot of articles

54
00:06:36,16 --> 00:06:37,28
and publications in German.

55
00:06:37,28 --> 00:06:45,51
Interviewer: When you say once you know how the key, you have easy access to the keys of languages

56
00:06:45,61 --> 00:06:54,83
and of inscriptions so, by having those keys, your generation is one of the first maybe that really just …

57
00:06:54,83 --> 00:07:02,28
Prakhaim: If I say generation, I mean the generation in Jordan.

58
00:07:02,28 --> 00:07:07,57
Europeans took care about this 100, 200 years ago, since 200 years.

59
00:07:08,64 --> 00:07:20,35
We are not the first in this field, and studying the ancient Arabian culture, either in Arabia, the Arabian Peninsula,

60
00:07:20,35 --> 00:07:27,82
or in Levant, the Europeans were pioneers in this regard, I'll say.

61
00:07:30,67 --> 00:07:40,29
Of course, and also they contributed in deciphering the ancient inscriptions, and my generation, which studied abroad,

62
00:07:40,29 --> 00:07:51,76
got the same experience and the same information they gained, I mean, the Europeans has gained before.

63
00:07:53,12 --> 00:08:09,14
Of course, on a daily … Inscriptions are discovered constantly, and some of them are still undeciphered,

64
00:08:09,14 --> 00:08:17,32
but we have of course inscriptions and languages that we understand and we can deal with the text

65
00:08:17,32 --> 00:08:25,09
and draw conclusions from the text, either on the linguistic, cultural, or any other level.

66
00:08:25,09 --> 00:08:38,51
Interviewer: I can imagine that such a beautiful thing that you discover through inscriptions,.

67
00:08:30,74 --> 00:08:38,43
through understanding languages, that you're discovering former cultures and former ..

68
00:08:38,51 --> 00:08:43,54
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, inscriptions are repositories of ancient history.

69
00:08:44,29 --> 00:08:51,35
Of course, if you discover an inscription, it means that you can understand a lot about the environment

70
00:08:53,07 --> 00:08:55,59
or the locality where the inscription is found.

71
00:08:56,2 --> 00:09:04,82
In certain cases, you can date the site, an archeological site, through the inscription.

72
00:09:04,82 --> 00:09:11,05
I mean, not only pottery, but also other inscriptional material can help us in dating archeological sites,

73
00:09:12,78 --> 00:09:20,19
and we have now, I mean, if the inscription is dated, for example,

74
00:09:20,61 --> 00:09:24,75
then now you have a fixed date of a certain site.	Sometimes the paleography, paleography,

75
00:09:24,75 --> 00:09:31,87
I mean the way you write inscriptions,

76
00:09:31,87 --> 00:09:43,13
it also gives you indications about the … it gives you some information about dating, about dating the site,

77
00:09:43,82 --> 00:09:45,75
but not in exact details.

78
00:09:46,22 --> 00:09:54,97
I mean, also, if you discover an inscription which is new and you are the first one who read it and understand it,

79
00:09:54,97 --> 00:10:03,93
then you convey to the humanity and you experience a new information that are, in my opinion,

80
00:10:03,93 --> 00:10:19,25
of great importance to understand the human creativity..

81
00:10:08,7 --> 00:10:18,96
Interviewer: When you decipher such an inscription, what does that do for ..

82
00:10:19,83 --> 00:10:25,7
It opens a window to a culture that was once here?

83
00:10:25,7 --> 00:10:27,00
Prakhaim: Yeah, of course.

84
00:10:27,00 --> 00:10:33,97
I mean, you understand, as soon as you discover and decipher an inscription and understand it,

85
00:10:34,91 --> 00:10:43,99
of course it opens a window to a lot of historical facts and cultural,

86
00:10:43,99 --> 00:10:47,94
historical facts about the region where it is discovered.

87
00:10:47,94 --> 00:10:54,86
Interviewer: When you say that you are, your generation, is one of the first from Jordan

88
00:10:54,86 --> 00:11:04,86
or from the Arabian Peninsula investigating or doing scientific research on these inscriptions, what does that mean,

89
00:11:05,1 --> 00:11:10,85
that you are the first from this region to do that? What does that say of …?

90
00:11:10,85 --> 00:11:13,57
Prakhaim: It means a lot.

91
00:11:13,57 --> 00:11:19,86
It means that we have now a generation from Jordan, from the area,

92
00:11:19,86 --> 00:11:32,52
from the region in general which can deal with its cultural heritage and understand it in the same historical

93
00:11:32,52 --> 00:11:34,85
and geographical context.

94
00:11:35,63 --> 00:11:43,14
If I talk about … I mean Europeans, they contributed in deciphering the inscriptions,

95
00:11:43,14 --> 00:11:50,29
they contributed in understanding the inscriptions, but sometimes, some of them of course, some of them,

96
00:11:50,29 --> 00:11:56,1
they lack the cultural background. I have to say that frankly.

97
00:11:56,1 --> 00:11:58,15
Some of them, they lack the cultural background,

98
00:11:58,16 --> 00:12:14,66
therefore their understanding of the entire story is a little bit vague. Now, in fact, we are not working alone here.

99
00:12:14,66 --> 00:12:20,51
We are working also with our European colleagues in Europe, mainly in Europe and the United States and other countries,

100
00:12:20,51 --> 00:12:29,68
and we exchange opinions about certain issues in this regard. After that, we reach a conclusion.

101
00:12:29,68 --> 00:12:36,79
Interviewer: But you bring in some extra layer, or a very important layer, because you are from this-

102
00:12:36,79 --> 00:12:39,47
Prakhaim: Yes, from the same region. Yeah.

103
00:12:40,13 --> 00:12:50,36
Yes, but I have to say my European colleagues also help in different regards, in different perspectives.

104
00:12:51,52 --> 00:12:58,32
We conduct joint surveys. We conduct also joint studies together.

105
00:12:58,51 --> 00:13:02,28
I think it’s important not from the scientific perspective,

106
00:13:02,29 --> 00:13:09,87
but also from the cultural perspective because it’s important to get in contact with our European colleagues.

107
00:13:11,6 --> 00:13:18,32
I mean, not only Europeans but outside Jordan, our colleagues from outside Jordan to have exchange,

108
00:13:19,48 --> 00:13:26,8
which means that we can do more for cultural understanding as well.

109
00:13:26,8 --> 00:13:32,36
Interviewer: Everybody say that as you’re born here, you’re raised here, you’re part of this culture,

110
00:13:32,36 --> 00:13:40,18
and you are one of the first working in this field and understanding those languages,

111
00:13:41,00 --> 00:13:47,23
that makes you a … that I can imagine that’s a very special role you have.

112
00:13:47,23 --> 00:13:49,27
A very important role, a very special role.

113
00:13:49,27 --> 00:13:57,74
Prakhaim: Yes, I personally can’t evaluate myself, whether I have a special role or not.

114
00:13:57,74 --> 00:14:06,86
It’s the academic world which would decide this..

115
00:14:04,17 --> 00:14:06,68
I’m not the one who decides that because I can’t [crosstalk 00:14:07]

116
00:14:06,86 --> 00:14:16,42
Interviewer: No, but what you do is you shed light on times that people here seems before not know much about.

117
00:14:16,42 --> 00:14:19,13
At least, how do you see that?

118
00:14:19,13 --> 00:14:23,04
Prakhaim: Yeah, that is true. Yeah, this is true.

119
00:14:23,04 --> 00:14:32,86
Well, some generations … I mean, what I want to say, that to be broadminded

120
00:14:32,86 --> 00:14:46,13
and to accept the opinion of others is crucial to understand and to exchange ideas,

121
00:14:46,6 --> 00:14:50,69
and also to reach reliable conclusions.

122
00:14:51,47 --> 00:15:01,11
I think that who would like to study this, the culture in general, should have a broad knowledge about a lot of things,

123
00:15:01,62 --> 00:15:10,57
not only history, not only languages, but also ancient history and also modern history and ancient cultures

124
00:15:11,11 --> 00:15:13,11
and modern culture.

125
00:15:13,11 --> 00:15:17,76
They are not separateable.	We cannot separate them because, I mean, [Batians 00:15:17]

126
00:15:20,53 --> 00:15:26,96
who lived in this area for a long time, they existed after that.

127
00:15:27,27 --> 00:15:33,02
What I’m talking about is the change of political entities while the people are the same.

128
00:15:33,21 --> 00:15:42,39
The people are the same, and they also continue to live in this area, in this region.

129
00:15:43,76 --> 00:15:55,09
I think we have to take into consideration a lot of perspectives towards studying a certain topic

130
00:15:55,09 --> 00:16:11,53
or a certain subject in our cultural history in general. Studying the past is connected with our living heritage.

131
00:16:12,17 --> 00:16:13,47
We cannot separate them.

132
00:16:13,47 --> 00:16:18,6
Interviewer: The fact that you shed light on the times that, before,

133
00:16:19,23 --> 00:16:23,98
people here wouldn’t know much about because it was not-

134
00:16:23,98 --> 00:16:24,98
Prakhaim: Yeah.

135
00:16:24,98 --> 00:16:34,62
Interviewer: Why is it? Why is it that you are one of the first to do just that?

136
00:16:34,62 --> 00:16:39,86
Prakhaim: No, I have some colleagues who are older than me and did that of course,

137
00:16:39,87 --> 00:16:53,08
but I think it’s important to have a generation here who is interested in its cultural heritage and cultural history.

138
00:16:53,08 --> 00:17:01,3
Interviewer: What I want to say is by being one of the first Jordanian, professor now

139
00:17:01,3 --> 00:17:07,25
but one of the scientists researching, investigating inscriptions and languages

140
00:17:07,25 --> 00:17:12,56
and shedding light on a time that somehow is not known about,

141
00:17:13,06 --> 00:17:23,33
why is it that those times … what makes those times were not seen or not accepted or not embraced before?

142
00:17:23,33 --> 00:17:37,39
Prakhaim: Yes, because if I take the Arabian Peninsula as an example, the Arabic sources, for example,

143
00:17:37,39 --> 00:17:45,88
that brought about the Arabian … that were concerned with the Arabian Peninsula and its history, they didn’t get,

144
00:17:46,43 --> 00:17:57,38
in fact, the access to ancient sources because at that time they hadn’t the instruments that give them the access,

145
00:17:57,65 --> 00:18:05,91
for example, to ancient South Arabian epigraphy or ancient North Arabian epigraphy or Novatian epigraphy.

146
00:18:06,00 --> 00:18:18,13
We are talking about a 200 years old discipline, not that ancient. It’s not that old. Yeah.

147
00:18:18,75 --> 00:18:31,35
We can expect that such Arabic sources do not cover the entire … I mean, they cover maybe 200 years before Islam,

148
00:18:31,35 --> 00:18:37,25
for example, but they don’t go deeper into history because the composer and the authors,

149
00:18:37,25 --> 00:18:43,76
they didn’t have the access into such an epigraphical source.

150
00:18:43,76 --> 00:18:45,3
Interviewer: That sort-

151
00:18:45,3 --> 00:18:52,91
Prakhaim: That’s why it’s important to take into consideration the archeological sources and epigraphical sources,

152
00:18:53,24 --> 00:19:00,03
as well maybe oral history as well. It’s also important.

153
00:19:00,03 --> 00:19:07,24
I mean, oral history is important to understand ancient cultures because the same people are still living.

154
00:19:07,24 --> 00:19:16,26
I mean, the same people who established the ancient cultures, their descendants are still there. Yeah.

155
00:19:16,26 --> 00:19:26,13
That’s why I feel it’s important to study the Arabian Peninsula in a holistic approach,

156
00:19:26,69 --> 00:19:35,04
where we can take into consideration the epigraphical sources, the archeology, in addition also to a living heritage.

157
00:19:35,04 --> 00:19:41,61
Interviewer: When you say like before, the ancient [inaudible 00:19:41]

158
00:19:41,61 --> 00:19:52,87
and cultures were not really part of the Arabic storytelling, of the Arabic history, that’s now changing then,

159
00:19:52,96 --> 00:19:57,02
I suspect, because you bring them the stories of those days?

160
00:19:57,02 --> 00:20:06,07
Prakhaim: Yes. Yeah, and now we have a new window to ancient history of the Arabian Peninsula. There is a new one.

161
00:20:06,28 --> 00:20:12,43
This new window was not possible to open without studying and deciphering the inscriptions,

162
00:20:12,43 --> 00:20:18,09
deciphering the ancient Arabian and Semitic inscriptions in general. Yeah.

163
00:20:18,09 --> 00:20:23,11
Interviewer: What does this window … Because I suppose much of the students you get,

164
00:20:23,54 --> 00:20:28,6
they are taught in a way that they don’t understand those times before.

165
00:20:28,6 --> 00:20:29,54
Prakhaim: Yes.

166
00:20:29,54 --> 00:20:37,95
Interviewer: How do they see that era when they come in your faculty?

167
00:20:37,95 --> 00:20:38,8
Prakhaim: Yeah, that’s a good question.

168
00:20:39,01 --> 00:20:49,18
In fact, students who come to our faculty, they have their own stereotype ideas about Arabia

169
00:20:49,18 --> 00:20:55,67
or about the Semitic cultures in general, but when they get deeply involved in this field,

170
00:20:55,67 --> 00:20:59,45
they start changing their understanding

171
00:20:59,45 --> 00:21:06,65
and also their methodology towards studying the cultural history of the Semitic world.

172
00:21:06,65 --> 00:21:09,57
Interviewer: What is their view when they come in?

173
00:21:09,57 --> 00:21:17,08
How do they see them when they don’t have this knowledge, the kind of ignorant times or-.

174
00:21:13,03 --> 00:21:16,81
Prakhaim: In fact, most of our students who are coming to the ..

175
00:21:17,08 --> 00:21:17,9
I mean,

176
00:21:17,9 --> 00:21:30,89
in fact they are selected because they know in pre-year what are they going to do because they have a little knowledge

177
00:21:30,89 --> 00:21:41,27
about this and about the cultural history of Arabia and the Semitic world in general.

178
00:21:41,27 --> 00:21:51,95
At the Institute, we train them and we conduct surveys so that they understand what we are doing in a better way.

179
00:21:51,95 --> 00:22:00,58
Interviewer: What is, I suppose, the view that they have … The people from Jordan or from the Arabian Peninsula,

180
00:22:00,58 --> 00:22:04,49
how do they see in general the times before Islam?

181
00:22:04,49 --> 00:22:17,56
Prakhaim: In fact, the Arabian Peninsula was a flourish … they had a flourishing civilization in Arabia before Islam,

182
00:22:18,01 --> 00:22:22,38
and the word “Jahiliyyah” or the ignorance period,

183
00:22:22,96 --> 00:22:30,02
I think it’s not the right word to use in this context because ignorance,

184
00:22:30,03 --> 00:22:38,22
it means that the people who were living there were ignorant and they were not in contact with the civilization,

185
00:22:38,22 --> 00:22:45,53
et cetera, but this is in fact a little bit … I mean, the idea should be modified a little bit.

186
00:22:45,53 --> 00:23:00,65
In fact, Arabia witnessed a flourishing culture economically and historically and culturally in general.

187
00:23:01,1 --> 00:23:07,96
It’s our rule now to present this culture, which was hidden in the inscriptions.

188
00:23:07,96 --> 00:23:11,08
Interviewer: That’s your role?

189
00:23:11,08 --> 00:23:11,27
Prakhaim: Yeah.

190
00:23:11,27 --> 00:23:11,71
Interviewer: Present? That’s your role?

191
00:23:11,71 --> 00:23:11,96
Prakhaim: I mean,

192
00:23:12,09 --> 00:23:21,29
to present the contents of this ancient heritage to be absorbed by the young generation because it’s part of their

193
00:23:21,29 --> 00:23:23,59
identity, it’s part of their history.

194
00:23:23,7 --> 00:23:37,48
I think it’s our role now to make them aware that Arabia is not … I mean maybe Jahiliyyah in terms of the religious

195
00:23:37,48 --> 00:23:56,69
perspective, but from the civilized perspective Arabia, I think, especially the southern parts and the central parts,.

196
00:23:46,26 --> 00:23:56,84
they are of a great importance and significance to understand the … Okay, I’m [inaudible 00:23:59].

197
00:23:56,69 --> 00:23:56,8
Interviewer:  [inaudible 00:23:59]

198
00:23:56,84 --> 00:24:04,11
Prakhaim: I think the sources give us a new glimpse.

199
00:24:04,11 --> 00:24:12,49
I mean, the ancient sources, the ancient inscriptions give us new glimpses on the hidden history

200
00:24:12,49 --> 00:24:17,64
and the hidden culture of Arabia before Islam.

201
00:24:18,41 --> 00:24:32,85
This is now evident through research and through archeological surveys, and through also studies published.

202
00:24:32,85 --> 00:24:44,71
You have thousands of publications in this regard, but most of them in fact are written in foreign languages.

203
00:24:44,72 --> 00:24:48,04
That’s why they are not accessible by Arab people.

204
00:24:48,75 --> 00:24:57,4
It’s our role now to, I mean, not to translate them, this is a huge literature,

205
00:24:57,43 --> 00:25:06,18
but to present the cultural history of Arabia in Arabic world.

206
00:25:07,1 --> 00:25:14,18
I think this is important now so that Arab people can have access to this source.

207
00:25:14,18 --> 00:25:25,59
Interviewer: When you studied several languages, you can lay connections so you create, I think,

208
00:25:25,59 --> 00:25:32,47
the worlds that had been here that before was not understood by people.

209
00:25:32,47 --> 00:25:36,43
Prakhaim: You mean the scholarly world or what?

210
00:25:36,43 --> 00:25:38,1
Interviewer: No, both.

211
00:25:38,93 --> 00:25:49,48
You’re putting a light on times that for most people was not known yet, so people understand now that, for example,

212
00:25:49,48 --> 00:25:56,16
here in Petra, that this is the culture of what it stands for.

213
00:25:56,16 --> 00:26:01,2
Prakhaim: Yes, of course. I have to say I’m not the first one in this regard, of course.

214
00:26:01,2 --> 00:26:02,37
Interviewer: Of course. I know.

215
00:26:02,37 --> 00:26:11,28
Prakhaim: But understanding … I mean, if you talk about epigraphy or the ancient languages, yes of course,

216
00:26:11,28 --> 00:26:16,51
as I said in the beginning, they are in fact the key to cultures.

217
00:26:16,51 --> 00:26:23,34
The Batian inscriptions are written in the Batian language, in the Batian script,

218
00:26:23,96 --> 00:26:26,96
and if you decipher the scripts then you understand the language

219
00:26:26,96 --> 00:26:33,36
and you understand after that the contents of a certain inscription.

220
00:26:34,2 --> 00:26:44,15
From this inscription, you can extract and draw conclusions regarding religious history, regarding commercial issues,

221
00:26:44,15 --> 00:26:48,43
regarding social relations among people at that time.

222
00:26:48,43 --> 00:27:01,49
I mean, through this knowledge, you can nurture the history of their region of course. Yeah.

223
00:27:01,49 --> 00:27:10,01
Interviewer: Do you see that also, that there are connections between the pre-Arabic worlds and the Arab world?

224
00:27:12,11 --> 00:27:15,49
That somehow, I mean, like … Yeah, do you see connections that before had not been seen?

225
00:27:15,49 --> 00:27:17,05
Prakhaim: Between the pre-Arab-

226
00:27:17,05 --> 00:27:20,02
Interviewer: Pre-Islamic worlds and the Islamic world.

227
00:27:20,02 --> 00:27:23,53
Prakhaim: Yeah. Yes, of course. Yes.

228
00:27:23,53 --> 00:27:28,02
Yes, of course, because people continue to exist in Arabia,

229
00:27:28,49 --> 00:27:37,08
and of course they got with them ancient traditions that continued until nowadays.

230
00:27:37,08 --> 00:27:40,25
Interviewer: Do you have examples of that?

231
00:27:40,25 --> 00:27:42,92
Prakhaim: Well, let us say something.

232
00:27:44,21 --> 00:27:49,76
Some ancient South Arabian inscriptions from Yemen, from present Yemen,

233
00:27:50,4 --> 00:28:01,05
in fact we rely on Yemeni dialects to understand the ancient inscriptions because some words that were there in ancient

234
00:28:01,05 --> 00:28:09,41
South Arabian inscriptions, they are still used in Yemen. This is a fact.

235
00:28:09,41 --> 00:28:20,32
Also, some rituals that existed, that we know from the inscriptions, are still existing until nowadays in Yemen,

236
00:28:21,59 --> 00:28:31,13
which means that this culture continue to exist apart of political changes, apart of economic changes,

237
00:28:31,14 --> 00:28:37,25
but people have preserved this cultural heritage and continued to transmit it.

238
00:28:37,25 --> 00:28:41,92
Interviewer: You said also the camel burial? Or is that another …?

239
00:28:41,92 --> 00:28:45,84
Prakhaim: No, it’s something different.

240
00:28:45,84 --> 00:28:49,92
Interviewer: That is something different? Okay, sorry for that. One …

241
00:28:49,92 --> 00:28:51,24
Prakhaim: That’s something different.

242
00:28:51,24 --> 00:28:55,17
I mean, the camel burial inscriptions, okay, it’s from Wadi Rum,

243
00:28:55,59 --> 00:29:09,37
but this is an evidence about resurrection that people in Arabia used to bury their camels with them so that they …

244
00:29:09,37 --> 00:29:12,71
Speaker 1: The camera has stopped. Maybe we should stop …

245
00:29:12,71 --> 00:29:19,52
Interviewer: Where did your passion for languages and inscription start?

246
00:29:19,52 --> 00:29:27,37
Prakhaim: Well, in fact this passion started after my … in fact, during my BA studies in Jordan,

247
00:29:27,6 --> 00:29:30,45
at Yarmouk University. At Yarmouk University.

248
00:29:31,24 --> 00:29:38,89
I tried my best to understand the Arabian culture in more deep and with more depth,

249
00:29:38,9 --> 00:29:50,61
but I didn’t find this during my BA studies because we were studying Arabic

250
00:29:50,61 --> 00:30:04,15
and Arabistic in general in a traditional way, studying the languages not in a diachronic way but in synchronic way.

251
00:30:05,4 --> 00:30:16,23
I started looking for programs that could help me in deciphering the ancient history of Arabic in general

252
00:30:16,46 --> 00:30:20,48
and the ancient history of the Arabian culture.

253
00:30:22,75 --> 00:30:33,32
That was after 1987, when I attended a Master program at the Institute of Archeology and Anthropology,

254
00:30:33,32 --> 00:30:34,65
where I studied Epigraphy

255
00:30:36,86 --> 00:30:47,87
and I finished my MA in Epigraphy.	My Master thesis was concerned with the lexical relationship between Arabic

256
00:30:48,27 --> 00:30:58,65
and Ugaritic. Ugaritic is one of the Bronze Age, late Bronze Age languages that existed on the Mediterranean Sea.

257
00:31:01,1 --> 00:31:09,22
I tried to find the lexical affinities between Arabic … some scholars call the classical Arabic or standard Arabic.

258
00:31:09,22 --> 00:31:20,67
There are different terminology. I mean, here, the Arabic of Koran and the pre-Islamic Arabian poetry.

259
00:31:21,31 --> 00:31:35,31
I found out that there are a lot of aspects that constitute the kind of lexical similarity between Ugaritic and Arabic.

260
00:31:38,15 --> 00:31:45,12
Yes, because this could be of course explained because both languages, they have the same mother language,

261
00:31:45,12 --> 00:31:47,63
which we call it … It’s a hypothetical language.

262
00:31:47,63 --> 00:31:59,26
We call it Proto-Semitic.	This lexical stuff could be from this genetic relationship,

263
00:31:59,27 --> 00:32:15,48
but this relationship could be also through historical factors, by migrations, by historical contacts,

264
00:32:16,59 --> 00:32:24,22
commercial contacts, et cetera, but we have a lot of historical models to explain this similarity.

265
00:32:25,21 --> 00:32:35,07
In general, most of the languages in Levant, the Levant and Arabia, and also in Mesopotamia, they are interconnected.

266
00:32:35,07 --> 00:32:43,03
We call them sister languages because they come from the same origin. The origin, we call it Proto-Semitic.

267
00:32:43,03 --> 00:32:50,59
Interviewer: To go back, what is your fascination for these old languages?

268
00:32:50,59 --> 00:32:57,62
Prakhaim: Yes, because in general I found the languages very … I mean,

269
00:32:57,87 --> 00:33:02,48
studying the language provide us with their right instruments to decipher cultures.

270
00:33:02,48 --> 00:33:15,74
I mean, for example, I did for five years the ancient Ethiopic, old Ethiopic language because my professor in Berlin,,

271
00:33:15,08 --> 00:33:16,66
Professor [Rhiner Folkt 00:33:12] he is a renowned professor in this field.

272
00:33:16,87 --> 00:33:21,61
I did with him five years studying ancient Ethiopic or old Ethiopic. Why?

273
00:33:24,68 --> 00:33:30,51
Because I wanted to understand the relationship between Arabia and the Horn of Africa.

274
00:33:30,51 --> 00:33:36,79
I mean, studying the language would explain a lot of historical facts

275
00:33:36,79 --> 00:33:46,02
and historical phenomena in terms of relationship between Arabia and the Horn of Africa. This is an example.

276
00:33:48,66 --> 00:33:54,48
As I said to you, because I was interested in exploring the history of Arabic language

277
00:33:57,7 --> 00:33:59,74
and the Arabic culture in general.

278
00:33:59,74 --> 00:34:04,81
Interviewer: Even before your studies, where did this fascination for languages

279
00:34:04,81 --> 00:34:07,95
and for these … where did it start and-

280
00:34:07,95 --> 00:34:13,9
Prakhaim: Yes. I was interested in languages even during my childhood.

281
00:34:15,52 --> 00:34:25,52
Also, my … That’s I was interested in English from the beginning, although I was studying Arabic,

282
00:34:27,53 --> 00:34:32,34
because I found out that studying a certain language would open

283
00:34:32,34 --> 00:34:43,00
and pave the way for me to get a deep information about certain aspects of our cultural history.

284
00:34:44,26 --> 00:34:55,72
From the beginning, I was interested in languages, but I can’t say how this evolved at the beginning..

285
00:34:54,39 --> 00:34:55,39
Speaker 1:  [inaudible 00:34:54]

286
00:34:55,72 --> 00:35:10,11
Interviewer: When you were really young, I mean when you were 10 or 11, how did it show? What was the fascination then?

287
00:35:10,11 --> 00:35:16,67
Prakhaim: The fascination in languages?.

288
00:35:15,64 --> 00:35:16,41
Interviewer: Mm-hmm (affirmative)

289
00:35:16,67 --> 00:35:29,27
Prakhaim: I can’t remember. I mean, I can’t make a sense of this in this regard.?

290
00:35:21,67 --> 00:35:28,93
Interviewer: Did you want to discover the world, understand the world? Did you want to be a [inaudible 00:35:26]

291
00:35:29,27 --> 00:35:38,17
Prakhaim: I don't know. I can say that we had no Internet at that time.

292
00:35:38,17 --> 00:35:46,77
The TV also was not accessible at that time because I was born in a village where electricity didn’t exist at that

293
00:35:46,77 --> 00:36:01,63
time until 1982, in fact. We had a radio and that was our window to the world.

294
00:36:03,94 --> 00:36:13,87
Of course I heard a lot of languages in the radio. I found out later that this is German, this is French.

295
00:36:13,87 --> 00:36:22,96
At that time, I couldn’t differentiate between German, French or Dutch or Swedish or Russian, but

296
00:36:24,93 --> 00:36:29,52
when I started to hear … I mean, there were voices, only voices for me,

297
00:36:29,52 --> 00:36:39,15
but there are certain points where the pronunciation is different from each other.

298
00:36:39,15 --> 00:36:50,34
Maybe this is one of the reasons why I was interested. I mean, I was interested in languages, because-

299
00:36:50,34 --> 00:36:55,29
Interviewer: How did you listen into the radio? Can you describe? This was in the living room?

300
00:36:55,29 --> 00:36:58,73
How did you know that you could find different languages?

301
00:36:58,73 --> 00:37:09,49
Prakhaim: Yeah, I can’t tell you. It was in the living room of course, yes. I don’t understand your question.

302
00:37:09,49 --> 00:37:11,26
Interviewer: How do you … It’s a radio. You hear those language. How did you do it?

303
00:37:11,26 --> 00:37:16,59
Were you scrolling through the channels?

304
00:37:16,59 --> 00:37:25,06
Prakhaim: Yes, yes, scrolling through the channels and trying to … Even within the Arabic sphere,

305
00:37:25,46 --> 00:37:31,45
and I try to … We have many dialects here in the Arab world and it was for me, at the beginning,

306
00:37:31,63 --> 00:37:36,42
difficult to understand, for example, the Algerian or the Moroccan dialect.

307
00:37:37,82 --> 00:37:49,4
This is one example why I tried to have the right instruments to study languages because the Arabic dialects,

308
00:37:49,4 --> 00:37:58,47
they could be considered as languages because sometimes they have different morphology and different syntax.

309
00:37:58,98 --> 00:38:05,1
This made me also enthusiastic to pursue studying languages.

310
00:38:05,1 --> 00:38:12,35
In fact, I can’t classify the factors why I was interested in language from the beginning. I don't know.

311
00:38:13,33 --> 00:38:17,49
I have no personal synthesis about this. Yeah.

312
00:38:17,49 --> 00:38:25,06
Interviewer: You were from a family that’s also scientific interested or …?

313
00:38:25,06 --> 00:38:26,5
Prakhaim: Yes.

314
00:38:26,51 --> 00:38:38,17
In fact, my family, they were interested in … I mean, my father is a businessman and my family in general,

315
00:38:38,17 --> 00:38:41,94
they used to earn money through business.

316
00:38:41,94 --> 00:38:47,17
It was my uncle, in fact, my elder uncle, who supported me

317
00:38:47,17 --> 00:38:58,12
and opened my eye to the academic world because he is considered one of the first graduates from the Jordan University.

318
00:39:00,14 --> 00:39:05,44
In fact, he supported my career, my studies,

319
00:39:05,67 --> 00:39:16,93
and also opened my eyes towards the world because he got in contact with the people in Amman, in the capital city,

320
00:39:16,93 --> 00:39:26,22
and also worldwide. That’s why he wanted me to deviate from the career of my family a little bit.

321
00:39:26,22 --> 00:39:37,73
Interviewer: When you [inaudible 00:39:28] described your … Well. What sparked your curiosity?

322
00:39:37,73 --> 00:39:46,59
Prakhaim: Well, regarding languages? Yeah. In fact, I am a patient guy.

323
00:39:46,6 --> 00:39:51,3
I have to say, I’m very patient, even from childhood.

324
00:39:52,05 --> 00:40:02,49
I used to help my father in his store and in his business since I was seven years old, in fact. I have to say that.

325
00:40:02,94 --> 00:40:13,19
This part of my life, this shaped my life to be a serious person because I didn’t … in fact,

326
00:40:13,2 --> 00:40:18,62
I didn’t enjoy most of the children my age enjoyed before.

327
00:40:22,03 --> 00:40:28,03
My father wanted me to be the best among the … in the village

328
00:40:28,03 --> 00:40:35,42
and he sent me first to a Roman Catholic school in Irbid. That was in 1970.

329
00:40:37,28 --> 00:40:39,11
The story of my academic life

330
00:40:39,11 --> 00:40:50,82
or my school life started there.	Due to the problems that occurred in Jordan at that time,

331
00:40:50,82 --> 00:40:57,23
well my father preferred that I go back to the village and to study there and to continue studying there,

332
00:40:57,23 --> 00:41:06,67
doing my preparatory, my elementary preparatory and secondary schooling, I did it in the village,

333
00:41:07,14 --> 00:41:16,69
and even in a village nearby where … and I used to walk from my house to that village for three kilometers sometimes.

334
00:41:17,23 --> 00:41:30,25
Maybe this stimulated me to think about the world and about sometimes the creation, about a lot of things,

335
00:41:30,25 --> 00:41:35,31
where usually school boys think sometimes.

336
00:41:35,6 --> 00:41:40,1
Some of them, they don’t think about it because they have their other interests.

337
00:41:40,1 --> 00:41:52,86
In fact, even this influenced my life and my future life, the university, even in Germany, and also later,

338
00:41:53,81 --> 00:42:05,79
I can see.	Well, during the preparatory and elementary period or phases, we used to study Arabic poetry,

339
00:42:06,08 --> 00:42:13,53
ancient Arabic poetry, and I was fascinated in fact with the contents of the Arabic poetry

340
00:42:13,53 --> 00:42:19,71
and how they can be recited in a rhythmic style.

341
00:42:21,64 --> 00:42:31,17
I was interested also to understand the words used in such passages, poetical passages.

342
00:42:32,52 --> 00:42:41,2
I can assure you that later I found out that our teachers, sometimes they explained in a traditional way,

343
00:42:41,2 --> 00:42:44,54
they explained some words in a traditional way, but I was not convinced.

344
00:42:45,51 --> 00:42:56,43
I was not convinced mostly in their explanations.	I keep this until I went to the university in 1983 where I attended

345
00:42:56,43 --> 00:43:05,86
the Arabic Program at Yarmouk University, and we went, in fact with the assistance of professors of Arabic Studies,

346
00:43:05,86 --> 00:43:20,51
we went in depth in studying the ancient Arabic poetry, but the problem, I didn’t find a solution for my problem.

347
00:43:20,51 --> 00:43:23,59
I mean, how to understand the Arabic poetry in a proper way

348
00:43:23,59 --> 00:43:39,64
and what are the origins of certain words in this Arabic poetry,.

349
00:43:33,27 --> 00:43:39,31
and also to explain how a linguistic phenomena could be ..

350
00:43:40,61 --> 00:43:50,55
How could we explain a certain linguistic phenomena in Arabic in particular, and within this wide context, I mean,

351
00:43:51,17 --> 00:43:55,38
within this wide Arabic context, where Arabic is used.

352
00:43:55,78 --> 00:43:59,03
As you know, Arabic is used in different parts of the world,

353
00:43:59,48 --> 00:44:06,84
and in fact that was not enough for me because I started to excavate

354
00:44:06,84 --> 00:44:16,99
and to dig for the origins of Arabic.	I found some of the answer during my MA studies.

355
00:44:16,99 --> 00:44:23,73
My MA studies where we’re exposed to, in fact, I have to say European experience.

356
00:44:23,74 --> 00:44:34,46
I was taught by different European professors and American professors at the Institute of Archeology.

357
00:44:30,66 --> 00:44:34,13
and Anthropology at that time. We were exposed to ..

358
00:44:35,79 --> 00:44:45,8
Also, we attended courses to study, for example, Canaanite, Ancient South Arabian, Old Ethiopic, Aramaic, et cetera,

359
00:44:46,37 --> 00:44:56,85
and all of these languages are sister languages and go back to one source or to one origin,

360
00:44:57,03 --> 00:44:58,56
which we called Proto-Semitic.

361
00:44:58,56 --> 00:45:16,04
Now, this in fact opened and paved the way for my future research, and since then I was interested in studying more

362
00:45:16,04 --> 00:45:27,22
and more, more ancient languages to understand Arabic and its context in a proper way. Well, as I-

363
00:45:27,22 --> 00:45:35,51
Interviewer: What makes now you unique in the world? It makes you unique.

364
00:45:35,51 --> 00:45:35,96
Prakhaim: Yes.

365
00:45:35,96 --> 00:45:36,88
Interviewer: Why?

366
00:45:36,88 --> 00:45:38,09
Prakhaim: I’m afraid of this word “unique.”

367
00:45:38,09 --> 00:45:39,8
Interviewer: It does?

368
00:45:39,8 --> 00:45:40,8
Prakhaim: Yeah.

369
00:45:41,65 --> 00:45:50,8
I’m trying to connect and to find the relationship between Arabic and its cultural and linguistic context.

370
00:45:51,38 --> 00:46:05,19
This is what I’m trying to show not only to my colleagues, also to my students, and also to make it known abroad.

371
00:46:08,95 --> 00:46:14,51
This methodology was not known in fact in the Arab world,

372
00:46:15,00 --> 00:46:25,7
how to connect Arabic with its surrounding languages through ages and also the culture where Arabic emerged. Yeah.

373
00:46:28,61 --> 00:46:37,25
This influenced, of course, my future studies and future research. I did my MA.

374
00:46:38,02 --> 00:46:42,82
I did my MA thesis on the relationship between Arabic and Ugaritic,

375
00:46:42,82 --> 00:46:51,97
because Arabic is an important source because it’s a language which existed and continue to exist in Arabia

376
00:46:52,31 --> 00:46:56,81
and the Levant also and of course in North Africa.

377
00:46:56,81 --> 00:47:07,11
Interviewer: One second, what do we have here?.

378
00:47:00,15 --> 00:47:07,1
Prakhaim: We hear the Adhan, Adhan [al Asr 00:47:01]

379
00:47:07,11 --> 00:47:07,2
Interviewer: What is that Adhan Asr?

380
00:47:07,2 --> 00:47:11,01
Prakhaim: Yeah. I mean, as you know, we have Islamic prayers, five prayers.

381
00:47:11,01 --> 00:47:18,48
This is the … We call it Adhan al Asr, which comes after afternoon.

382
00:47:18,48 --> 00:47:29,65
Interviewer: You said at a certain moment when you were young you listened to this Arabic poetry.

383
00:47:29,09 --> 00:47:30,2
and [inaudible 00:47:26] I'm sorry?

384
00:47:30,2 --> 00:47:34,78
Prakhaim: In fact, it was included in the curricula of the school. Yeah.

385
00:47:34,78 --> 00:47:40,07
Also, I hear that some people improvised it

386
00:47:40,07 --> 00:47:48,09
and I was interested in understanding the meaning of this poetry in a proper way.

387
00:47:48,09 --> 00:47:51,07
We usually … People recite this poetry,

388
00:47:51,29 --> 00:47:56,31
but they sometimes don’t understand the cultural backgrounds of this poetry.

389
00:47:56,84 --> 00:48:02,69
I was interested in the cultural background, not only on how to be recited.

390
00:48:02,69 --> 00:48:11,87
It’s beautiful to hear it, but I was interested in understanding the cultural dimensions of this poetry

391
00:48:13,04 --> 00:48:15,19
and its language.

392
00:48:15,19 --> 00:48:17,02
Interviewer: You missed that in the recital?

393
00:48:17,02 --> 00:48:18,16
Prakhaim: Yes.

394
00:48:18,17 --> 00:48:27,24
This is what I missed in fact during my school period, also I can say even during my BA period at the university,

395
00:48:27,8 --> 00:48:33,57
because they used to teach us in a traditional way, trying to explain.

396
00:48:33,57 --> 00:48:41,57
They couldn’t explain the cultural backgrounds of this poetry.

397
00:48:43,59 --> 00:48:46,65
Not only the cultural backgrounds,

398
00:48:46,65 --> 00:48:56,39
but also the contained lexical items that were for me very difficult to understand as a young guy,

399
00:48:57,07 --> 00:49:06,21
because the Arabian poetry represents, or the Arabic poetry, represents a very old stage of the Arabic literature

400
00:49:08,08 --> 00:49:14,91
and I can’t say that it was disconnected from the people,

401
00:49:14,92 --> 00:49:20,93
but it represented a certain cultural phase in the Arabian peninsula.

402
00:49:22,27 --> 00:49:30,97
In future stages of my life, I was interested to understand in depth the cultural background

403
00:49:30,97 --> 00:49:39,08
and the cultural context of this poetry. Also, the Koran, the beginning of Islam.

404
00:49:39,08 --> 00:49:44,59
I mean, the language of Koran was also for me a very difficult language to understand,

405
00:49:44,88 --> 00:49:54,86
and I think we can shed some light on the Koranic text from different languages that existed in Arabia before Islam,

406
00:49:54,86 --> 00:49:58,56
because some words continued to be used ….

407
00:49:57,67 --> 00:49:58,34
Interviewer:  [inaudible 00:49:58]

408
00:49:58,56 --> 00:50:06,72
Prakhaim: … continued to be used at that time and also they were part of the Koranic Text,

409
00:50:07,37 --> 00:50:17,97
and I was interested in understanding such words in Koran and I have some research on this regard.

410
00:50:17,97 --> 00:50:22,47
I started a project on this regard. Yeah.

411
00:50:22,47 --> 00:50:27,42
Interviewer: To go back, do you remember the poem, the first poem that makes you …?

412
00:50:27,42 --> 00:50:29,65
Prakhaim: Well, in fact,

413
00:50:31,13 --> 00:50:37,14
I’m interested in the pre-Islamic Arabian poetry which goes back to the so-called Jahiliyyah poetry

414
00:50:37,14 --> 00:50:41,83
or the Jahiliyyah Age or the ignorance period.

415
00:50:42,37 --> 00:50:52,58
For example, the poems of Antar and Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma and other poets.

416
00:50:52,58 --> 00:50:57,25
Interviewer: Can you recite one?.

417
00:50:54,58 --> 00:51:02,82
Prakhaim: Well, no. Not .. No. Also, [inaudible 00:50:59] and other people. Other people.

418
00:51:02,82 --> 00:51:07,68
I wasn’t prepared to do this, because if you-

419
00:51:07,68 --> 00:51:11,94
Interviewer: Then I'd like to go back to the last thing which you said about Koranic.

420
00:51:11,94 --> 00:51:12,94
Prakhaim: Yeah.

421
00:51:12,94 --> 00:51:16,68
Interviewer: What are you doing with that?

422
00:51:18,95 --> 00:51:24,45
You see that it also notice disconnect from the people, but somehow it’s a language form that is not-

423
00:51:24,45 --> 00:51:28,41
Prakhaim: I mean, the poetry was definitely not connected.

424
00:51:29,7 --> 00:51:37,35
It emerged in a cultural context, of course, because this poetry describes the people,

425
00:51:37,35 --> 00:51:47,05
describes their relationship with the environment. It describes also their understanding of the world at that time.

426
00:51:47,05 --> 00:51:47,49
Interviewer: Sorry.

427
00:51:47,79 --> 00:51:53,56
I mean, when we go back to do Koran, the Koranic, you were saying that you now, with what you’re finding,

428
00:51:53,68 --> 00:52:00,15
you are finding new words also for the Koran or you find new lexical-

429
00:52:00,15 --> 00:52:01,55
Prakhaim: No. I’m not finding new words. No.

430
00:52:01,81 --> 00:52:14,32
I mean, well, there are certain Koranic words that could be interpreted in a different way.,

431
00:52:12,94 --> 00:52:17,99
Okay, the Arab [inaudible 00:52:13] they contributed a lot to understanding the Koran,

432
00:52:18,43 --> 00:52:29,26
but in some cases we can do more to understand this text through the languages that existed in Arabia at that time.

433
00:52:29,26 --> 00:52:36,02
Interviewer: Because they have also their roots?

434
00:52:36,02 --> 00:52:43,68
Prakhaim: Yes, of course. I mean, such words, they have their roots in the languages of Arabia before Islam. Yeah.

435
00:52:43,68 --> 00:52:49,26
I mean, we have, for example, some words that were Arabized. They became Arabic.

436
00:52:50,16 --> 00:52:57,75
Although they are foreign words, but they became Arabic and they became part of the Arabian linguistic culture

437
00:52:58,9 --> 00:53:05,04
and you found them in different pre-Islamic Arabian texts.

438
00:53:05,86 --> 00:53:14,84
Also, some of them are known in the Koranic text, because they are not in fact … they were foreign words,

439
00:53:15,1 --> 00:53:17,86
but they were Arabized. They took the Arabic shape.

440
00:53:20,08 --> 00:53:24,76
As usual, in the interchange between languages, it’s known and have been-

441
00:53:24,76 --> 00:53:28,97
Interviewer: You are discovering that now from your …?

442
00:53:28,97 --> 00:53:42,35
Prakhaim: Well, I’m trying to deal with certain words and to understand them in a different lexical context.

443
00:53:42,35 --> 00:53:46,15
Interviewer: What do you mean by that?

444
00:53:46,15 --> 00:53:51,42
Prakhaim: I mean, to interpret them in the light of ancient Semitic languages that existed in Arabia before Islam.

445
00:53:51,42 --> 00:54:03,5
Interviewer: Can you give examples?,

446
00:53:55,52 --> 00:54:03,5
Prakhaim: Yes. There are some examples.,

447
00:53:59,00 --> 00:54:12,3
I mean, for example, the verse [foreign language 00:54:03] which has been interpreted, “We opened your chest,”

448
00:54:13,17 --> 00:54:22,49
and there are different interpretations, but we go back, for example, to ancient South Arabian linguistic culture,

449
00:54:22,72 --> 00:54:28,01
we find that the root “ [sharha 00:54:24] ”, it means to protect, which means, in fact,

450
00:54:28,02 --> 00:54:35,68
if we reinterpret this word, it means that we … I mean, God has protected Muhammad’s heart.

451
00:54:40,39 --> 00:54:47,44
This helps us to understand the text in a better way and it’s for the benefit of Koran, in fact.

452
00:54:47,44 --> 00:54:59,92
It’s for the benefit of Koran to use the ancient languages and to shed light on Koran through other language,

453
00:55:00,15 --> 00:55:05,89
other Arabian languages..

454
00:55:01,88 --> 00:55:06,56
Interviewer: Okay. Then we go back to when you .. We were with your students.

455
00:55:06,77 --> 00:55:13,75
You were with your students in the mountains, looking at the stones and this enormous terrain.

456
00:55:13,75 --> 00:55:24,44
When you look for them and for yourself, when you envision your future, the ideal dream of what they can do,

457
00:55:24,61 --> 00:55:32,85
what you can do here in this area, how do you envision that over 10, 15 years?

458
00:55:32,85 --> 00:55:38,86
Prakhaim: Well, how do I envision my students or the field in general?.

459
00:55:37,52 --> 00:55:40,86
Interviewer:  [inaudible 00:55:36] I put the question wrong.

460
00:55:42,53 --> 00:55:51,52
When you look in your field of work with your students, you would walk into boundaries, as what you explained before.

461
00:55:51,53 --> 00:55:57,31
What do you envision for the coming 10 years or what do you want them to find out

462
00:55:57,31 --> 00:56:00,36
and what is it that you yourself want to find out?

463
00:56:00,36 --> 00:56:05,09
Prakhaim: I would like to continue in this field,

464
00:56:05,66 --> 00:56:17,24
and of course I hope that my students can continue as well because this is a message that we have to hand out to other

465
00:56:18,59 --> 00:56:28,52
future generations. I hope that we can establish a kind of school, I mean, a school, academic school, to understand ...

466
00:56:29,00 --> 00:56:37,86
Which aims at understanding our Arabian culture from the Arabian Peninsula and also in the Levant. Yeah.

467
00:56:38,41 --> 00:56:43,68
That’s what my aim, that they continue on the same discipline

468
00:56:43,68 --> 00:56:49,54
and also that they continue also in training the future generations.

469
00:56:49,54 --> 00:56:54,4
Interviewer: When you look, because you walk into limitations,

470
00:56:54,41 --> 00:57:01,58
you said you were the first one that shed a light in an era where much of the people, you didn’t see the light.

471
00:57:02,04 --> 00:57:11,36
What do you think that your students will … what kind of windows are they able to open?.

472
00:57:07,8 --> 00:57:15,49
Prakhaim: Well, I hope .. I mean, of course they can … I don’t know.

473
00:57:15,59 --> 00:57:20,45
I mean, it’s of course their decision to follow my discipline or not,

474
00:57:21,12 --> 00:57:31,89
but definitely they are going to contribute in understanding the Arabian culture in its widest context.

475
00:57:31,89 --> 00:57:40,16
I'd like them to work on the history of Arabic.

476
00:57:40,77 --> 00:57:48,95
I would advise them to work intensively on the history of Arabic as a language and culture.

477
00:57:51,03 --> 00:58:00,84
For the future, I think because they have now a wide knowledge, I mean, a wide knowledge in languages,

478
00:58:00,84 --> 00:58:03,18
modern languages and also ancient languages,

479
00:58:03,94 --> 00:58:12,55
and they have also the capability … they are capable to deal with other cultures.

480
00:58:12,55 --> 00:58:18,33
Not only ancient cultures, also more modern cultures in the world.

481
00:58:18,81 --> 00:58:24,27
I think they have more and better opportunity than I have, what I had before. Yeah.

482
00:58:24,27 --> 00:58:26,96
Interviewer: A lot of stones, too.

483
00:58:26,96 --> 00:58:27,6
Prakhaim: Yes.

484
00:58:27,6 --> 00:58:39,91
I mean, okay, we have to continue documenting the inscriptions spread all over the Jordanian terrain

485
00:58:39,91 --> 00:58:48,08
and this needs many generations in the future to be prepared for this task.

486
00:58:48,65 --> 00:58:52,32
It’s not a task of one generation or two generations.

487
00:58:52,4 --> 00:59:00,01
We have to train many generations so that they can continue documenting our cultural heritage.

488
00:59:00,01 --> 00:59:10,61
I mean, not only stones and inscriptions, but also archeology and tangible heritage and intangible heritage.

489
00:59:10,87 --> 00:59:18,75
I can’t divide culture into parts. They are all interconnected.

490
00:59:18,75 --> 00:59:27,61
There are a lot of aspects that are interconnected and can … after my studying these aspects,

491
00:59:27,89 --> 00:59:32,64
we can draw a clear picture about our culture.

492
00:59:32,64 --> 00:59:39,51
Interviewer: What are you doing now? What is your focus now?

493
00:59:39,51 --> 00:59:49,28
Prakhaim: Now, I am involved in different projects and research endeavors in general.

494
00:59:51,43 --> 00:59:53,71
I’m now conducting a field work.

495
00:59:53,71 --> 01:00:08,92
It’s a long … It’s a field work which I’m going to continue for the next few years in the so-called

496
01:00:08,92 --> 01:00:14,66
[Harra 01:00:08] Region, in the volcanic region we visited.

497
01:00:16,88 --> 01:00:24,72
I’m also trying to involve foreign institutions to work with me in this field work.

498
01:00:28,77 --> 01:00:36,52
We are trying to document as far as possible the ancient North Arabian inscriptions from Northern Jordan

499
01:00:36,52 --> 01:00:40,89
and from the so-called Northeastern Badia.

500
01:00:43,94 --> 01:00:54,38
It has a lot of … I mean, the surfaces of stones constituted an ideal [canva 01:00:51] for writing inscriptions.

501
01:00:54,97 --> 01:01:03,22
Those inscriptions were written by people who were in the area.

502
01:01:04,36 --> 01:01:07,74
Maybe they had a Bedouin character, but it is not definite,

503
01:01:09,01 --> 01:01:13,44
and there is a countless number of inscriptions in this area

504
01:01:13,44 --> 01:01:22,12
and they need to be documented for future studies so that we understand more and more about the people and the area

505
01:01:22,12 --> 01:01:23,72
and the history of the area.

506
01:01:23,72 --> 01:01:29,64
Interviewer: When you look around you, the whole Jordan, this was a land of milk and honey.

507
01:01:29,64 --> 01:01:29,71
Prakhaim: Yes.

508
01:01:29,71 --> 01:01:35,54
Interviewer: I mean, it’s one big archeological black hole you still have to discover.

509
01:01:35,54 --> 01:01:37,99
Prakhaim: Yes. I mean, I’m not the only person.

510
01:01:38,4 --> 01:01:44,76
In fact, in my institute at the Yarmouk University and the other institutes you saw today,

511
01:01:45,85 --> 01:01:53,88
you have found out that we are trying to train students and to train new generation to take the burden,

512
01:01:54,29 --> 01:01:58,91
to continue this responsibility in studying the cultural heritage of Jordan.

513
01:01:58,91 --> 01:02:05,21
Interviewer: What I want to say, all these rocks have a story.

514
01:02:05,21 --> 01:02:05,67
Prakhaim: Yes, of course.

515
01:02:05,67 --> 01:02:08,71
Interviewer: You are the one so far that found some of the stories,

516
01:02:08,71 --> 01:02:13,89
but I mean this is one big landscape of rocks wanting to speak.

517
01:02:13,89 --> 01:02:20,06
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, this is true, but-

518
01:02:20,06 --> 01:02:20,8
Interviewer: What is true? Sorry?

519
01:02:20,8 --> 01:02:28,35
Prakhaim: I mean, everywhere you find inscriptions, everywhere you find aspects of cultural heritage here in Jordan.

520
01:02:28,35 --> 01:02:37,5
As I said, we need generations and generations that continue to document and study this cultural heritage.

521
01:02:37,5 --> 01:02:41,81
It is an evidence that this area contributed in the human history.

522
01:02:41,81 --> 01:02:49,82
It is an evidence … What we see here is an evidence that this area, this region contributed to the human creativity.

523
01:02:49,82 --> 01:02:52,62
It’s an evidence on human creativity.

524
01:02:56,71 --> 01:03:06,69
We are trying to widen the spectrum of this knowledge, not only among the academics

525
01:03:06,69 --> 01:03:12,44
but also among the local community so that they can feel that they have old history and they are proud of.

526
01:03:12,44 --> 01:03:17,28
Interviewer: So that they understand that old history and that they’re proud of it?

527
01:03:17,28 --> 01:03:20,31
Prakhaim: Yes.

528
01:03:20,32 --> 01:03:28,97
This is our intention, not only studying the cultural heritage in academic way, but also to let people know

529
01:03:28,97 --> 01:03:36,21
and to let the community know that they have ancient history which contributed in the development of humanity as part

530
01:03:36,21 --> 01:03:40,02
of the development of civilizations. Yeah.

531
01:03:40,02 --> 01:03:41,99
Interviewer: It’s quite a struggle.

532
01:03:41,99 --> 01:03:56,59
Prakhaim: Yeah. I mean, I don’t know. This is something … but this is evident. I mean, as you see, everywhere …

533
01:03:56,59 --> 01:03:57,43
Interviewer: For you, it is evident.

534
01:03:57,43 --> 01:03:57,87
Prakhaim: Huh?

535
01:03:57,87 --> 01:04:01,01
Interviewer: For you, it’s evident, but this is also for the people evident?

536
01:04:01,01 --> 01:04:03,54
Prakhaim: I mean, for the people, I don’t think so.

537
01:04:03,55 --> 01:04:11,97
I don’t think that old people in Jordan, it’s evident for them that Petra, for example,

538
01:04:13,4 --> 01:04:17,96
that it’s contributed in the human development and the human civilizations.

539
01:04:17,96 --> 01:04:22,07
For my father, for example, he never visited Petra.

540
01:04:23,34 --> 01:04:33,72
He’s from the local Jordanian community, but he didn’t visit Petra before. I’m speaking of myself. Yes.

541
01:04:33,72 --> 01:04:36,5
Interviewer: Why not?

542
01:04:36,5 --> 01:04:44,00
Prakhaim: Well, okay, he’s 72 years old. He has his own interests.

543
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:49,96
He’s a businessman and he’s maybe not interested in this field,

544
01:04:50,71 --> 01:05:07,5
but I promised him to take home to Petra in maybe one or two years. I’m trying to convince him. My concern-.

545
01:05:00,79 --> 01:05:08,04
Interviewer: Is it difficult to convince him? You are the one that ...

546
01:05:07,5 --> 01:05:07,95
Prakhaim: Yes. That’s [crosstalk 01:05:07]

547
01:05:08,04 --> 01:05:08,84
Interviewer: … discovered its history, I mean.

548
01:05:08,84 --> 01:05:18,42
Prakhaim: This is the paradox because I'm the one who should make him aware about our ancient heritage,

549
01:05:18,43 --> 01:05:20,17
but I'm now concerned …

550
01:05:20,17 --> 01:05:26,56
Interviewer: What you’re saying is, it is strange, your father-

551
01:05:26,56 --> 01:05:26,85
Prakhaim: Yes.

552
01:05:26,85 --> 01:05:32,71
Interviewer: You want … you opened the window and your father has to be convinced to join you

553
01:05:32,71 --> 01:05:33,93
and look through the window?

554
01:05:33,93 --> 01:05:39,73
Prakhaim: Yes, through my window. Yeah. Yes, this is a kind of paradox.

555
01:05:40,16 --> 01:05:49,11
I can’t explain that, but he didn’t get the right education to be aware of the importance of our cultural heritage.

556
01:05:50,93 --> 01:05:53,41
We are trying this within the generation now. Yeah.

557
01:05:53,41 --> 01:05:56,67
Interviewer: When you look at this paradox,

558
01:05:56,67 --> 01:06:04,94
because your father stands for much more people than … he stands for the Jordan, for the general opinion about it.

559
01:06:04,94 --> 01:06:07,24
Prakhaim: No, not necessarily general opinion. No.

560
01:06:07,24 --> 01:06:13,73
I mean, in his age, there are people who are interested, who are interested in this heritage and-

561
01:06:13,73 --> 01:06:22,43
Interviewer: Is it sometimes, do you feel lonely … Is it sometimes difficult to know so much of that beautiful era

562
01:06:22,79 --> 01:06:29,34
and, as you see, so many people that you’re going to convince or try to convince,

563
01:06:29,34 --> 01:06:33,69
is it also a lonely feeling that you are one of the few that understands it?

564
01:06:33,69 --> 01:06:37,46
Prakhaim: Yes. Sometimes, yes. Yeah, this is true.

565
01:06:37,98 --> 01:06:44,00
I feel myself sometimes alone even among my colleagues at the university.

566
01:06:44,00 --> 01:06:45,03
Interviewer: Why? How come? Why?

567
01:06:45,03 --> 01:06:47,99
Prakhaim: I mean, not in my faculty, but in general.

568
01:06:47,99 --> 01:06:49,41
Interviewer: Yeah, but it was-

569
01:06:49,41 --> 01:06:58,32
Prakhaim: Young generation now is interested in different things, in IT and business administration, finance,

570
01:06:58,32 --> 01:06:59,32
et cetera.

571
01:07:00,3 --> 01:07:09,67
This field is not … Okay, it’s respected in Jordan, but students mostly are interested,

572
01:07:10,05 --> 01:07:18,6
or young generation is interested in majors through which they can earn money.

573
01:07:19,68 --> 01:07:28,29
I have to admit, through archeology and heritage, this is sometimes difficult. Yeah.

574
01:07:28,29 --> 01:07:31,18
Interviewer: That makes you lonely?

575
01:07:31,18 --> 01:07:35,05
Prakhaim: Well, yeah. Maybe yes. Yeah.

576
01:07:35,05 --> 01:07:43,03
Maybe, but I have some colleagues here in Jordan with whom I can communicate and exchange ideas.

577
01:07:43,18 --> 01:07:51,66
I have also colleagues from Europe and the States, in the United States, and we exchange ideas and opinions,

578
01:07:51,67 --> 01:08:03,4
but mostly we remain in the academic realm. That’s the problem..

579
01:07:57,69 --> 01:08:03,34
The challenge now, how to raise awareness about the importance ..

580
01:08:03,4 --> 01:08:09,92
I mean, how to raise awareness among the community members about this important cultural heritage,

581
01:08:10,65 --> 01:08:18,04
which should be disseminated and get known to a wide range of people. This is a challenge.

582
01:08:18,04 --> 01:08:26,58
I mean, okay, as an academic, I do my part, but there are other parties that can work with us.

583
01:08:27,04 --> 01:08:32,18
For example, the media now, media can reach everybody in his room

584
01:08:32,18 --> 01:08:37,91
and I think we have to work on this now in the next stage.

585
01:08:37,91 --> 01:08:38,91
Interviewer: Yeah.

586
01:08:40,27 --> 01:08:49,57
Then you do your start with the rest of the history of Jordan because this also has to be discovered

587
01:08:49,57 --> 01:08:52,32
or has to be understood?

588
01:08:52,32 --> 01:08:57,74
Prakhaim: Yeah. It have to be studied, discovered, explored. Yeah, but I’m just one person.

589
01:08:58,17 --> 01:09:07,34
That’s why I said that we have to build a generation to get involved in studying this culture.

590
01:09:07,34 --> 01:09:21,07
Interviewer: Yeah. What is your dream? When you’re thinking 10, 15 years, what is your ideal Jordan look like?

591
01:09:21,07 --> 01:09:23,33
Prakhaim: Jordan-

592
01:09:23,33 --> 01:09:24,22
Interviewer: As in, in your-

593
01:09:24,22 --> 01:09:25,85
Prakhaim: In my field?

594
01:09:25,85 --> 01:09:27,89
Interviewer: In your field.

595
01:09:27,89 --> 01:09:28,89
Prakhaim: Yes.

596
01:09:28,89 --> 01:09:41,08
I expect or I hope and wish that we are going to establish an academic school here in Jordan,

597
01:09:41,08 --> 01:09:46,82
academic school not in terms of university or in the way of thinking in this field.

598
01:09:48,57 --> 01:09:55,7
I think I’m part of this generation now, because I was trained in Jordan for my BA and MA,

599
01:09:55,96 --> 01:10:03,96
and I’m very proud to get my first training in Jordan and it was consolidated by my study in Germany

600
01:10:03,96 --> 01:10:09,02
and my academic stays in Europe and the United States.

601
01:10:09,37 --> 01:10:22,00
I’m sure that we are going further and try with the future generation, of course, to build this academic school,

602
01:10:22,00 --> 01:10:30,5
this academic school of thought in the field of cultural heritage in general. Yeah.

603
01:10:30,5 --> 01:10:35,89
Interviewer: When you look at the field where you’re now researching, where we were before,

604
01:10:35,89 --> 01:10:44,15
is it like … that’s quite a lot of work also, all those stones. Are all those stones ready?

605
01:10:44,15 --> 01:10:45,95
Prakhaim: Yeah, not all the stones.

606
01:10:46,4 --> 01:10:53,84
As we have seen yesterday, we had to penetrate in the desert for 40 kilometers to find the place,

607
01:10:54,53 --> 01:10:58,24
to find the site where we worked before.

608
01:10:59,22 --> 01:10:59,8
Yes,

609
01:10:59,8 --> 01:11:07,91
there's a countless number of such inscriptions that’s spread over the stones in the desert right there in the north,

610
01:11:07,91 --> 01:11:12,83
I mean, Northeastern Badia. Yeah, of course, they need expertise. They need scholars.

611
01:11:13,43 --> 01:11:19,31
They need more trained students and also research institutions.

612
01:11:19,31 --> 01:11:32,3
It was I suggested once a day to establish a kind of a research center there in the desert, so that such inscriptions,

613
01:11:32,3 --> 01:11:39,64
such archeology, such science can be easily accessible to us. Yeah.

614
01:11:39,64 --> 01:11:45,44
I mean, this is one of my dreams, to establish a research center there.

615
01:11:45,44 --> 01:11:48,14
Speaker 1: Where do they publish their findings?

616
01:11:48,14 --> 01:11:49,03
Interviewer: Where do they publish their findings?

617
01:11:49,03 --> 01:11:59,26
Prakhaim: Well, usually either we publish the findings in books or we publish them in journals in different languages,

618
01:11:59,26 --> 01:12:02,32
Arabic, German, English. Yeah.

619
01:12:02,32 --> 01:12:12,84
Those languages are accessible for us, and sometimes in French, because some of my colleagues graduated from France

620
01:12:13,17 --> 01:12:20,71
and England, for example, and they prefer to write in the languages they mastered.

621
01:12:20,71 --> 01:12:24,96
Interviewer: Here in Jordan?.

622
01:12:23,39 --> 01:12:24,81
Prakhaim: Yes. Of course, we have ..

623
01:12:25,26 --> 01:12:34,37
In fact the academic situation and the level of education in Jordan is good here

624
01:12:34,37 --> 01:12:42,17
and it has a high standard in comparison to other institutions in the region.

625
01:12:42,17 --> 01:12:47,83
Interviewer: Can you, for example, also the stories that shed light on this era, pre-Islamic era,

626
01:12:48,87 --> 01:12:56,05
is it easy to share it with the general public? Is it allowed?

627
01:12:56,05 --> 01:13:01,02
Prakhaim: Yeah, of course. Yes. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we can share it with the public.

628
01:13:01,02 --> 01:13:03,86
We hold conferences about our new discoveries.

629
01:13:03,86 --> 01:13:12,68
In a few, I think it will … we are planning for a workshop I think in March,

630
01:13:12,68 --> 01:13:22,23
2016 on this subject about new discoveries in Jordan, new epigraphical discoveries in Jordan. Yes.

631
01:13:22,23 --> 01:13:32,74
There's no problem to share the information with the public, because sometimes we compose our articles

632
01:13:33,18 --> 01:13:40,33
and research papers in Arabic and Arabic is accessible for everybody in Jordan.

633
01:13:40,33 --> 01:13:45,2
Interviewer: Now that you kind of mentioned about it, but I’m also meaning is it is sometimes, I suppose,

634
01:13:45,34 --> 01:13:55,9
difficult to … when you have a lot of people who think of the time before as ignorant, as an ignorant time,

635
01:13:56,7 --> 01:14:01,31
to let them know and look through this window, you see a different world.

636
01:14:01,31 --> 01:14:06,75
Prakhaim: Yes. Yeah..

637
01:14:01,66 --> 01:14:06,41
Interviewer: Like what you’re saying about what you’re doing with [inaudible 01:14:05]

638
01:14:06,75 --> 01:14:09,97
Prakhaim: Yeah, this is true.

639
01:14:09,97 --> 01:14:13,71
In fact, the best way is to implement

640
01:14:13,71 --> 01:14:22,25
or to use the modern media to make the people aware about what we are discovering.

641
01:14:22,8 --> 01:14:33,73
I’m trying my best now to convince my university to integrate this discipline, this academic discipline,

642
01:14:34,23 --> 01:14:39,75
into different academic fields.

643
01:14:39,75 --> 01:14:50,1
Not only in archeology, in the archeological context, but also maybe in the Department of Arabic Studies,

644
01:14:50,1 --> 01:14:57,45
because the Arabic Studies, Departments of Arabic Studies in the Arab world,

645
01:14:57,45 --> 01:15:07,46
they are in fact not totally concerned with the ancient sources that we encounter in Arabia before Islam.

646
01:15:07,46 --> 01:15:13,69
Interviewer: What is the essence of what they are finding, what you are finding?

647
01:15:13,69 --> 01:15:26,42
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, it’s very essential to understand cultural, historical aspects on the basis of inscriptions.

648
01:15:27,00 --> 01:15:28,26
For example,

649
01:15:29,03 --> 01:15:39,56
we know that Arabia has had always a constant contact with the surrounding that we discovered through the inscriptions,

650
01:15:39,88 --> 01:15:50,05
through the texts. We know, for example, that Arabia had contacts with Egypt, with Greece, with Asia, with the other ...

651
01:15:50,5 --> 01:15:58,53
With the Asian Modern Turkey, which was Asia Minor, and also with other remote areas.

652
01:15:58,68 --> 01:16:08,03
For example, in the Semite say, they reached Morocco and reached Tunisia and Morocco.

653
01:16:08,55 --> 01:16:17,05
Through the inscriptions, we can find out how those people, how the Semitic people in this area were in strong

654
01:16:17,05 --> 01:16:21,32
and constant contact with the other people in the world.

655
01:16:21,32 --> 01:16:28,12
Interviewer: Why is it you work … You find all these findings, and it’s very important information,

656
01:16:28,12 --> 01:16:35,4
but we look around in a part of the world where all kind of conflicts emerge now around Jordan.

657
01:16:35,4 --> 01:16:44,08
Prakhaim: Yeah.,

658
01:16:35,78 --> 01:16:45,44
Interviewer: Which is all about historical, well, misconceptions also. I mean, [crosstalk 01:16:43] there’s all kind.

659
01:16:45,62 --> 01:16:48,8
You have countries that say you have to believe this and you do it like that.

660
01:16:49,09 --> 01:17:03,48
You have groups that says it’s like this and you should do it. How is that?.

661
01:16:54,72 --> 01:17:03,41
I can imagine that that is a lonely feeling when in this part of the world where they treat history ..

662
01:17:03,48 --> 01:17:09,49
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, that’s why we have to understand history in the proper way.

663
01:17:09,59 --> 01:17:16,17
We don’t have to politicize history. This is the most dangerous thing.

664
01:17:20,17 --> 01:17:30,86
Every group tries to say that, "I’m the one who follows the right way," but this is not true.

665
01:17:30,86 --> 01:17:41,03
I mean, we have a basic ground, a basic ground which we have to understand it as it is.

666
01:17:41,66 --> 01:17:51,06
We don’t have to reflect our political backgrounds on the culture.

667
01:17:51,06 --> 01:17:57,08
If we politicize, I don’t know whether I’m using the right word, if we understand culture

668
01:17:57,81 --> 01:18:07,76
and religion as well in their political context, definitely the result will be dangerous. Yeah.

669
01:18:07,76 --> 01:18:09,65
Interviewer: You see that?

670
01:18:09,65 --> 01:18:19,34
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, that’s what’s happening now in the surrounding region. I mean, it’s difficult.

671
01:18:19,34 --> 01:18:22,18
Yeah, every group has its own understanding

672
01:18:22,18 --> 01:18:34,73
and they defend that in different ways because of the lack of cultural dialog. I’m dreaming of-

673
01:18:34,73 --> 01:18:42,54
Interviewer: Could you explain to me what it means what you are doing, and what people you work with are doing,

674
01:18:42,71 --> 01:18:46,83
for the enhancement of identity and the enrichment of identity?

675
01:18:46,83 --> 01:18:56,09
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, maybe as you have seen, that I’m working in different fields, but they are interrelated.

676
01:18:57,67 --> 01:19:08,25
I’m using the information contained in the inscriptions in order to reach a certain result.

677
01:19:08,25 --> 01:19:16,84
I’m using also information gained from cultural heritage in general, especially the intangible cultural heritage,

678
01:19:16,84 --> 01:19:28,73
to put these results together in order to show how cultural heritage in general is important for identity.

679
01:19:28,73 --> 01:19:36,19
In fact, identity is not contained only in inscriptions, but also in other sources.

680
01:19:36,19 --> 01:19:45,79
I mean, for example, the Arabian poetry is part of our history. It’s part of our identity, or the Arabic poetry.

681
01:19:45,79 --> 01:19:50,85
Also, the Holy Book, Koran, is also part of our identity.

682
01:19:50,85 --> 01:19:55,75
Of course, it’s written in Arabic and I think it’s very crucial

683
01:19:55,75 --> 01:20:02,84
and important to understand what the others wrote about Koran.

684
01:20:02,84 --> 01:20:09,42
There are several institutions in Europe and the United States that take care … I mean,

685
01:20:09,42 --> 01:20:18,01
that study Koran from a different perspective and a different methodology.

686
01:20:18,01 --> 01:20:27,62
A lot of studies appeared in the last 20 years about Koran from Germany, France, and other countries in the world,

687
01:20:28,00 --> 01:20:31,69
but I have the problem,

688
01:20:31,69 --> 01:20:43,73
or I think I would suggest to the academic institutions in the Arab world to start understanding what the Europeans

689
01:20:43,73 --> 01:20:48,6
wrote about this book, about this Holy Book in fact,

690
01:20:49,1 --> 01:20:56,58
so that we can understand from the methodological level how the European scholars study Koran.

691
01:20:57,47 --> 01:21:00,25
Because studying the Koran traditionally,

692
01:21:03,34 --> 01:21:15,23
without taking into consideration the new publications written in different languages, for example in German, French

693
01:21:15,23 --> 01:21:24,18
or Russian, I don’t know, I think it would lead to a kind of … I don’t know.

694
01:21:24,18 --> 01:21:31,23
It could lead to a kind of misunderstanding of the others and their work concerning Koran.

695
01:21:33,85 --> 01:21:46,36
Because it’s, for me, important to show how Europeans dealt with the Koran in general especially in the last 20,

696
01:21:46,36 --> 01:21:48,28
50 years ago.

697
01:21:48,28 --> 01:21:58,12
All their literature about Koran mostly translated into Arabic and we knew the contents of it, but in the last 20,

698
01:21:58,12 --> 01:22:08,49
50 years, we have … I mean, Arab scholars who has no access to foreign languages, this will remain for them closed.

699
01:22:08,49 --> 01:22:17,71
I mean, this literature written in other languages remains for them closed. They don’t know a lot about it.

700
01:22:18,24 --> 01:22:25,3
That’s why I suggest that we start translating this into Arabic. Yeah.

701
01:22:25,3 --> 01:22:32,84
Interviewer: That’s the core of who you are. I mean, languages are the key.

702
01:22:32,84 --> 01:22:35,84
Prakhaim: Yes, are the key of cultures. Yeah.

703
01:22:35,84 --> 01:22:39,43
Interviewer: Also to understand identity, your own identity.

704
01:22:39,43 --> 01:22:40,39
Prakhaim: Yes, of course.

705
01:22:40,5 --> 01:22:49,03
I mean, well, studying ancient written sources that are written in Arabian languages

706
01:22:49,03 --> 01:23:00,12
and studying also their cultural connotations in addition to their cultural backgrounds,

707
01:23:00,12 --> 01:23:09,4
and this would shed the light on the people who wrote these texts and also make them feel proud about our identity.

708
01:23:09,4 --> 01:23:11,46
Interviewer: And understanding their identity.

709
01:23:11,46 --> 01:23:14,97
Prakhaim: Yeah, and to understand it in a proper way. Yeah.

710
01:23:14,97 --> 01:23:15,76
Interviewer: Yeah.

711
01:23:16,28 --> 01:23:25,59
For that reason, the languages, the understanding of languages form the basis for … You know what I mean?

712
01:23:25,59 --> 01:23:30,04
Prakhaim: Yes, of course. The languages are the keys.

713
01:23:30,04 --> 01:23:39,02
They are the keys to cultures, and cultural values are contained in cultures.

714
01:23:41,2 --> 01:23:48,33
Studying the languages is of course the key to understand the cultural backgrounds.

715
01:23:48,69 --> 01:23:56,53
Especially regarding ancient civilizations, because they don’t exist anymore,

716
01:23:56,53 --> 01:24:02,84
but we have the text that have been left by those who composed them.

717
01:24:03,12 --> 01:24:12,89
We can get some glimpses about the cultural background from these texts

718
01:24:13,96 --> 01:24:18,79
and they would help us in enhancing the identity.

719
01:24:18,79 --> 01:24:20,08
Interviewer: That’s why your work is so important.

720
01:24:20,08 --> 01:24:20,93
Prakhaim: Thank you very much.

721
01:24:20,93 --> 01:24:24,29
Interviewer: Don’t you think yourself that it's important?

722
01:24:24,29 --> 01:24:24,96
Prakhaim: Yeah, of course.

723
01:24:25,14 --> 01:24:36,24
I mean, I think it’s an important discipline, which should be supported in every Jordanian institution.

724
01:24:37,11 --> 01:24:38,48
Academic institution, I mean.

725
01:24:38,48 --> 01:24:41,97
Interviewer: And by every Jordanian.

726
01:24:41,97 --> 01:24:43,29
Prakhaim: Yes, of course.

727
01:24:43,29 --> 01:24:47,32
First of all, we have to start in the academic institutions,

728
01:24:47,32 --> 01:24:56,01
and then we should think in a further step how to disseminate this knowledge among the local communities.

729
01:24:56,01 --> 01:25:02,46
Interviewer: Yeah..

730
01:24:56,61 --> 01:25:02,43
There’s also people that visit Petra, for example, understand what Petra is and that’s [crosstalk 01:25:01]

731
01:25:02,46 --> 01:25:02,68
Prakhaim: Yes, of course. Yeah.

732
01:25:02,68 --> 01:25:05,81
Interviewer: Because now it’s sometimes used as a kind of a … not a-

733
01:25:05,81 --> 01:25:12,41
Prakhaim: Well, yeah, this is the difficult story to film because now Petra is being consumed,

734
01:25:12,87 --> 01:25:17,05
if we remain investing it in this way.

735
01:25:18,28 --> 01:25:35,14
I feel that Petra is part of our identity here in Jordan and we have to preserve it.

736
01:25:26,42 --> 01:25:34,8
and safeguard it as a cultural space for the future generations because it is ..

737
01:25:35,14 --> 01:25:46,5
I mean, a site like Petra is a place which is unparalleled in the world.

738
01:25:47,16 --> 01:25:54,66
We are very proud to have it, but we have in the same time to do our best to safeguard it

739
01:25:54,66 --> 01:25:58,18
and also to present it in a proper way.

740
01:25:58,18 --> 01:26:09,29
In addition to it being as part of our identity in Jordan,

741
01:26:09,3 --> 01:26:15,93
I think it’s also a source for income generation for the national income.

742
01:26:20,69 --> 01:26:29,73
We have the ability here in Jordan to start working on the sites in a proper way to conserve it

743
01:26:29,73 --> 01:26:39,75
and to safeguard it for future generations. This also can be applied to other sites in Jordan.

744
01:26:39,76 --> 01:26:45,34
As you mentioned before, Jordan is a museum. It’s an open museum.

745
01:26:45,34 --> 01:26:52,86
If you travel from the north to the south, you will always encounter cultural heritage sites or nature sites,

746
01:26:56,13 --> 01:27:01,46
and they constitute of course a part of our local identity.

747
01:27:01,46 --> 01:27:03,59
Interviewer: They only have to see it then?

748
01:27:03,59 --> 01:27:05,96
Prakhaim: Yes. I mean, this is an important thing as well.

749
01:27:06,18 --> 01:27:15,13
We have to make the people aware, aware of the importance of such archeological sites or heritage sites in general.

750
01:27:15,13 --> 01:27:21,31
Interviewer: Because by understanding it, they understand their own identity?

751
01:27:21,31 --> 01:27:22,2
Prakhaim: Yeah, definitely.

752
01:27:22,2 --> 01:27:25,5
Interviewer: That they understand they are more than just an Islamic

753
01:27:26,41 --> 01:27:36,11
or just they’re more … that there’s more than the Islamic history?

754
01:27:36,11 --> 01:27:39,73
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, I feel that this part is not certain. I mean, like-

755
01:27:39,73 --> 01:27:40,7
Interviewer: Okay, okay.

756
01:27:40,7 --> 01:27:49,26
Prakhaim: I mean, Islam is also a part of our history, part of our identity as well. If you want to … I don’t know.

757
01:27:49,26 --> 01:27:54,28
Do you want me to say it again?

758
01:27:54,28 --> 01:27:57,73
Interviewer: Well, you can say it in … Yeah, you can say it again the way you like.

759
01:27:57,73 --> 01:27:58,36
Prakhaim: Yes.

760
01:27:58,36 --> 01:28:03,02
In fact, it’s not only the cultural heritage is part of our identity

761
01:28:03,02 --> 01:28:15,12
and the religious identity of the people who are living in Jordan is part of the entire identity of the Jordanian

762
01:28:15,12 --> 01:28:16,24
community.

763
01:28:17,08 --> 01:28:19,93
We have Muslims, we have Christians here in Jordan,

764
01:28:19,93 --> 01:28:27,26
but they constitute … both religions here in Jordan are part of our identity as Jordanians in whole.

765
01:28:27,26 --> 01:28:31,2
Interviewer: And Arabs as a whole?

766
01:28:31,2 --> 01:28:33,00
Prakhaim: Yeah, yeah. As Arabs of course, yes.

767
01:28:33,00 --> 01:28:38,42
Interviewer: Yeah. So a lot of work to do for you?

768
01:28:38,42 --> 01:28:43,5
Prakhaim: Yes. In fact, I am an individual, but I’m trying my best.

769
01:28:45,07 --> 01:28:59,25
As I mentioned, I hope that we can cooperate with the young generation too, then to have a group of researchers,

770
01:28:59,25 --> 01:29:06,33
a group of interested people, not only from the academic institutions

771
01:29:06,34 --> 01:29:11,63
but also from the local communities to work together

772
01:29:11,63 --> 01:29:22,71
and to cooperate so that we can enhance our identity as Jordanians, as Muslims, Christians, and as Arabs.

773
01:29:22,71 --> 01:29:23,71
Interviewer: Yeah.

774
01:29:23,71 --> 01:29:24,38
Prakhaim: Yeah.
