1
00:00:00,59 --> 00:00:11,67
So I had someone son is a Texan related name. What did your grandfather just grand grand grand parents do.

2
00:00:11,67 --> 00:00:14,88
You know and well you know before we start yeah so

3
00:00:15,1 --> 00:00:20,69
when you say that you mean like my ancestry Yeah your answer we're going back to yesterday yeah just for a while Oh OK

4
00:00:20,73 --> 00:00:23,81
OK.

5
00:00:23,81 --> 00:00:24,19
We came

6
00:00:24,2 --> 00:00:31,83
and we killed Indians No kidding you know we did well OK a little bit anyway you know what we're doing group is one of

7
00:00:31,84 --> 00:00:36,22
my ancestors and what do you write Yeah well.

8
00:00:36,22 --> 00:00:43,81
My ancestors came to Texas in the early eighty's hundreds with a gentleman named Moses Austin which is a great name for

9
00:00:43,82 --> 00:00:46,71
somebody who's going to lead you into a new land.

10
00:00:46,71 --> 00:00:52,78
And they became a part of what we call in Texas the first three hundred which are the first three hundred settlers they

11
00:00:52,79 --> 00:01:01,3
came in under the Spanish Empire they pledged loyalty to the king they became Catholics. And.

12
00:01:01,3 --> 00:01:08,6
Began to settle in Texas and then over time became a part of.

13
00:01:08,6 --> 00:01:16,29
The founding activities that actually started what was at the time the nation of Texas.

14
00:01:16,29 --> 00:01:23,08
We're very proud of the fact in Texas that we're actually a country for. Nine years.

15
00:01:23,08 --> 00:01:30,79
You kind of helps define our attitude a little bit which is different than you'll see in most people in the U.S.

16
00:01:30,83 --> 00:01:37,05
You know it's funny whenever I'm overseas in customs things like that they ask you.

17
00:01:37,05 --> 00:01:42,74
Where you're from and I'll say Texas instead of us.

18
00:01:42,74 --> 00:01:48,44
So we you know our family is very much of a plane or in spirit we're not a wealthy family

19
00:01:48,45 --> 00:01:54,78
but we're very proud of our heritage and the nice thing about heritage is you don't have to be wealthy to have one

20
00:01:55,06 --> 00:02:03,58
but you can be proud so yeah we helped start. Texas very very.

21
00:02:03,58 --> 00:02:11,53
Means a lot to us missile launches the lady showed you some documents that you have just so for.

22
00:02:11,53 --> 00:02:18,51
Some of the documents she showed us yesterday I'd never seen before some of the letters from my ancestors back

23
00:02:18,52 --> 00:02:26,26
and forth in the in the colony at the time. Were very interesting to me and.

24
00:02:26,26 --> 00:02:32,56
We're constantly finding new things out about our ancestors I a couple of years ago found that there was a book written

25
00:02:33,16 --> 00:02:39,23
called the Fighting Tomlinson's a Texas Ranger legacy it's out of print now

26
00:02:39,77 --> 00:02:48,76
but it does turn out that we have thirty eight Texas Rangers in my family and we helped start the Texas Rangers.

27
00:02:48,76 --> 00:02:53,97
So yeah heritage is is very important to us.

28
00:02:53,97 --> 00:02:58,52
I don't live out of it every day it's not something I walk around Away Hey you know

29
00:02:58,9 --> 00:03:10,03
but it is it helps with the foundation of who you are it helps you be able to relate especially in my case the fact

30
00:03:10,04 --> 00:03:18,35
that my ancestors helped open this frontier put me in a position psychologically from a very young age to be focused on

31
00:03:18,36 --> 00:03:24,66
the next. Focus is on being a senator.

32
00:03:24,66 --> 00:03:33,01
You know much yeah you might my ancestors were subtle as they left a place that they didn't want to be in

33
00:03:33,05 --> 00:03:40,51
and went to a new place that they knew very little about they brought their tools they brought their out of tude they

34
00:03:40,52 --> 00:03:50,27
came as part of a community. And. Settled it turned it into a place which they could call home.

35
00:03:50,27 --> 00:04:03,5
And then to form New York current idea of settling into a state. Absolutely absolutely I. It had a great deal.

36
00:04:03,5 --> 00:04:17,98
As a child. Story to my head so. HOW DID I DO You are of the Center for you as a kid or your idea that there's.

37
00:04:17,98 --> 00:04:26,09
You know when I was a child I was exposed to a lot of different inputs.

38
00:04:26,09 --> 00:04:31,5
I remember I was an asthmatic and so I spent a lot of time reading.

39
00:04:31,5 --> 00:04:39,87
And I read science fiction at the same time I spent a lot of time out in West Texas with my grandparents.

40
00:04:39,87 --> 00:04:50,57
And they would let me roam and I would go out into the out into the desert and explore. And yet.

41
00:04:50,57 --> 00:04:58,17
At the same time as all of that was going on I also had my English background because I spent several years in England.

42
00:04:58,17 --> 00:05:01,08
And there was this feeling of the.

43
00:05:01,08 --> 00:05:06,42
The edge of exploration that I picked up there and it all kind of blended together

44
00:05:07,42 --> 00:05:17,92
and underlying everything was this thing about being a Texan being from a family of settlers.

45
00:05:17,92 --> 00:05:20,17
And I think you know

46
00:05:20,18 --> 00:05:27,84
when you're a child these things kind of can blur together into helping you create an identity for yourself so for me

47
00:05:28,8 --> 00:05:44,88
it really became sort of projected on the future what my family had taught me about our past. While dreaming of space.

48
00:05:44,88 --> 00:05:51,85
One of the reasons to be frank about it is probably I didn't like where I was in other words.

49
00:05:51,85 --> 00:05:59,5
We escape to places that make us feel. Good better stronger and more excited.

50
00:06:00,52 --> 00:06:09,81
That's why we have fantasy that's why we have science fiction that's why we have movies. And so for me.

51
00:06:09,81 --> 00:06:17,08
Dealing with what I was dealing with as a child I had a way to escape I could read science fiction stories in these

52
00:06:17,09 --> 00:06:23,77
heroes on these rocket ships and going off to new worlds in space and they were doing all kinds of incredible things

53
00:06:23,78 --> 00:06:32,93
and I could as any child would reading those books visualize myself as those heroes doing those things.

54
00:06:32,93 --> 00:06:36,66
And I really think that's that's why that's why we have fiction

55
00:06:36,67 --> 00:06:43,78
but in my particular case rather than you know being reading detective novels

56
00:06:43,79 --> 00:06:52,25
or something else I went into the future and inhabited that and it in a sense inhabited me.

57
00:06:52,25 --> 00:07:03,04
Somehow you were going to live your dream. When I was growing up and one of the funny things when I was growing up.

58
00:07:03,04 --> 00:07:08,57
What was happening was that. We had the Apollo program.

59
00:07:08,57 --> 00:07:14,25
And so you would turn on the evening news and you would see several things happening you would see Vietnam

60
00:07:14,26 --> 00:07:23,24
and the Cold War this imminent threat hanging over our heads that we were going to die in a nuclear attack at any time

61
00:07:23,3 --> 00:07:26,14
between the US and the Soviets.

62
00:07:26,14 --> 00:07:27,81
And then you'd flip the channel

63
00:07:28,57 --> 00:07:35,59
and we'd be doing these incredible things in space there's Mercury Gemini Apollo Soyuz all of these cool things so it

64
00:07:35,6 --> 00:07:41,37
was like bad news bad news bad news look we're doing something it's base and then you turn the next channel

65
00:07:41,62 --> 00:07:48,28
and there's Captain Kirk you know going into the you know places no one has gone before.

66
00:07:48,28 --> 00:07:58,55
As a child I think that those positive ideas of what the future could be like being reinforced as they were at that

67
00:07:58,56 --> 00:08:00,17
moment in my life by.

68
00:08:00,2 --> 00:08:08,28
What was really happening I put them together and I said Of course I want to take what's happening now

69
00:08:08,32 --> 00:08:14,5
and I want to go do that and then you roll in underneath it the idea of my family being settlers

70
00:08:14,51 --> 00:08:24,29
and part of the frontier and you've got this who I am now and what I do. So what was the first moment you realized you.

71
00:08:24,29 --> 00:08:38,76
Well were going to. The road of the road of actually working on it you know going out.

72
00:08:38,76 --> 00:08:49,26
There was there were several steps in my life. Of which point each one moved me further. I remember sitting in college.

73
00:08:49,26 --> 00:08:58,52
On the floor of my student union. And watching this. Icon of the one nine hundred seventy S.

74
00:08:58,53 --> 00:09:09,07
and Sixty's Timothy Leary giving a speech about colonies in space that this guy named Gerard Cale Neal had come up with.

75
00:09:09,07 --> 00:09:18,27
And I was just inspired it all came home to me that I want to help make that happen. I didn't know how.

76
00:09:18,27 --> 00:09:25,46
Because I was such a rebellious student I had walked out of my class as I was taught as many of us do that I was

77
00:09:25,47 --> 00:09:31,94
smarter than my teachers and so I would have fights with my professors and my teachers

78
00:09:31,95 --> 00:09:38,8
and I would storm out of the class and drop the classes. But I stayed in school.

79
00:09:38,8 --> 00:09:44,64
Mainly because it gave me community and I guess that's where the girls were but it kept me going

80
00:09:44,65 --> 00:09:49,31
and so I see I sit in the Student Union of my my school

81
00:09:49,32 --> 00:09:53,47
and there is Timothy Leary showing colonies in space Gerard Kay O'Neill's ideas

82
00:09:53,81 --> 00:10:00,17
and I decided that I want to make that happen but I didn't know how. So then a few months later and the.

83
00:10:00,71 --> 00:10:09,73
Amazing coincidences I guess because the one thing I had been doing was doing tech support for theater I find myself

84
00:10:09,74 --> 00:10:20,06
backstage. With a guy named Gene Roddenberry. And he had just created a television series.

85
00:10:20,06 --> 00:10:29,54
Sorry So starting on yeah not again I scratch my head and that whole story some of it I mean Larry oh OK here we go.

86
00:10:29,54 --> 00:10:31,37
So when they I.

87
00:10:31,37 --> 00:10:35,49
Was so so when I was in college just I find myself sitting on the floor of the student union

88
00:10:35,97 --> 00:10:43,23
and there's a guy speaking in Timothy Leary he's talking about colonies in space where people would live that were

89
00:10:43,24 --> 00:10:47,65
created the idea that was created by God in droid K. O'Neill.

90
00:10:47,65 --> 00:10:49,77
And I wanted to make that happen

91
00:10:50,49 --> 00:10:58,36
but I didn't know how because I'd been such a rebel in my school yelling at my teachers walking out of classes I never

92
00:10:58,37 --> 00:11:00,94
was finishing all my classes.

93
00:11:00,94 --> 00:11:10,99
But I did find myself at one point working in my school's theater department doing tech and so there I was at this.

94
00:11:10,99 --> 00:11:15,66
Lecture and there was a guy there named Gene Roddenberry who created Star Trek

95
00:11:16,6 --> 00:11:23,44
and for a few minutes I was backstage with him alone and.

96
00:11:23,44 --> 00:11:31,38
I had to ask I said you know I love Star Trek I want to make that happen how do I do that how do I do it because I'm

97
00:11:31,77 --> 00:11:40,84
you know I'm a terrible student. And Mr EISENBERG. Said just stick to your guns.

98
00:11:40,84 --> 00:11:44,29
Stay with your dream don't ever give up.

99
00:11:44,29 --> 00:11:47,96
And I said Well that that's great but how do I take my skills

100
00:11:48,58 --> 00:11:55,32
and help us create the world of Star Trek how do i help us move into space and he stopped

101
00:11:55,33 --> 00:12:05,13
and he said Do you know what I was before the television series. And I did know he said I was an L.A. Cop.

102
00:12:05,13 --> 00:12:17,08
I used to drive around in a police car. And it kind of blew my mind what it told me. Because in my mind. As many.

103
00:12:17,08 --> 00:12:22,75
Kids probably have today in their mind you have to be an engineer or a scientist

104
00:12:22,76 --> 00:12:27,14
or have some specialty that's directly related to.

105
00:12:27,14 --> 00:12:31,02
Building rockets and things like that to be able to participate in the opening of the frontier

106
00:12:32,02 --> 00:12:39,75
when he told me that I realized I didn't have to I realized I could just take whatever it was mainly my passion

107
00:12:40,57 --> 00:12:47,87
and apply it to the cause and as long as I stayed in there and I studied a lot on my own.

108
00:12:47,87 --> 00:12:56,27
And worked hard I would eventually be able to make a contribution and he apparently was somewhat right.

109
00:12:56,27 --> 00:13:08,36
You also studied that Garrett and you saw even his books have become your Bible. Gerry O'Neill. Is.

110
00:13:08,36 --> 00:13:18,00
I'm sort of saying it was crack. So what about your. Jury O'Neill is.

111
00:13:18,00 --> 00:13:28,55
Far too often overlooked in what is happening in space. Right now everybody thinks it's one mosque or Jeff Bezos or.

112
00:13:28,55 --> 00:13:36,34
Richard Branson and or the X. PRIZE or this or that or the other that made all of this happen or.

113
00:13:36,34 --> 00:13:38,75
You know or let's say it's the old space program

114
00:13:38,76 --> 00:13:48,07
and those guys the guy who is really responsible for making a lot of what is happening today occur is drug Keanu he

115
00:13:48,08 --> 00:13:50,95
wrote a book called the high frontier in the one nine hundred seventy S.

116
00:13:51,91 --> 00:13:57,15
and You have to think about that period for a moment we had been to the moon.

117
00:13:57,15 --> 00:14:03,96
We had Galileo and Voyager going out into the saw. Or system we could do anything.

118
00:14:03,96 --> 00:14:11,84
And you know we had Star Trek on our T.V.'s all of these kind of inputs into this generation that had just come was in

119
00:14:11,85 --> 00:14:16,64
the middle of the Cold War We just come through Vietnam we needed something to excite us

120
00:14:17,09 --> 00:14:24,07
and ahead of us in the early Eighties was this idea of a thing called the space shuttle

121
00:14:24,57 --> 00:14:30,33
and we were told it was going to fly fifty times a year it was only going to be one hundred dollars a pound to go into

122
00:14:30,34 --> 00:14:33,71
space we could do anything.

123
00:14:33,71 --> 00:14:35,95
And doctrine you know wrote a book called the high frontier

124
00:14:36,72 --> 00:14:42,96
and in this book he basically said you don't have to be an astronaut you don't have to be a part of a government

125
00:14:42,97 --> 00:14:50,95
program to participate in the opening of space take your ideas take your passion take your tools

126
00:14:51,57 --> 00:14:54,77
and utilize the resources of space

127
00:14:55,68 --> 00:15:01,65
and you could build settlements colonies you could build families out there in the frontier

128
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:09,42
and the book which was called the high frontier inspired a lot of us so.

129
00:15:09,42 --> 00:15:12,98
On top of that what he did was he formed an organization

130
00:15:13,5 --> 00:15:18,83
and then he started having a conference in Princeton which he called the space manufacturing conference

131
00:15:19,5 --> 00:15:25,66
and we used to call it the not ready for primetime conference and we would go out to this conference

132
00:15:25,7 --> 00:15:34,04
and say things that you couldn't say at a normal space conference at the time for example maybe somebody will buy a

133
00:15:34,05 --> 00:15:43,77
ticket to go into space maybe there's things in the asteroids that we can use to build a civilization maybe there's ice

134
00:15:43,78 --> 00:15:50,53
on the moon maybe I as an individual could start a space company and do something important.

135
00:15:50,53 --> 00:15:54,64
And people would take you seriously he and his partner Freeman Dyson

136
00:15:54,65 --> 00:16:00,17
and Dr John Lewis would be sitting at the front of the room going that's an interesting idea and I.

137
00:16:00,53 --> 00:16:06,95
The young crazy Turks of the time would sit there and sail of these things and interact with each other

138
00:16:07,11 --> 00:16:14,67
and started creating a community now out of that community came most of the different space organizations we have here

139
00:16:14,68 --> 00:16:17,28
in the United States.

140
00:16:17,28 --> 00:16:24,64
The National Space Society my organization the Space Frontier Foundation the International Space University the X.

141
00:16:24,65 --> 00:16:33,2
PRIZE students for the exploration development space eventually the Mars Society all of these organizations go back to

142
00:16:33,21 --> 00:16:46,39
Dr O'Neill. By the Bible. So this is the one of the original copies of the high frontier that Dr and you know wrote.

143
00:16:46,39 --> 00:16:52,08
And here's what's really interesting about it if you think of this versus maybe what you saw back then from NASA

144
00:16:52,09 --> 00:16:55,76
and space agencies it's green.

145
00:16:55,76 --> 00:17:02,61
That's a neighborhood in that this is a rotating facility that provides gravity but whether it's in space on the moon

146
00:17:02,62 --> 00:17:08,05
or on Mars really doesn't matter at the core. It's green.

147
00:17:08,05 --> 00:17:16,15
There are communities houses there are people living in here working together just as we do outside in the town where

148
00:17:16,16 --> 00:17:17,97
we live so

149
00:17:18,24 --> 00:17:27,77
when he did this book he was able to tap into something that we hadn't seen before right even even if you go back to

150
00:17:27,81 --> 00:17:30,8
the core of science fiction people like Buck Rogers

151
00:17:30,81 --> 00:17:39,1
and these are these guys well Rockstar heroes you know superheroes they gladiators of space things like that Dr O'Neill

152
00:17:39,11 --> 00:17:51,4
said that's wonderful but let's just go build a home. And it touched us. It put inside of us this idea that.

153
00:17:51,4 --> 00:18:00,17
We're just extending who we are out there that we have the right stuff all of us. It's interesting hearing.

154
00:18:00,48 --> 00:18:13,87
Cares about humans space absolutely absolutely you know. There was. This might give you a troll but there was.

155
00:18:13,87 --> 00:18:22,19
The old space program that the one that the Cold War Space Program what I call the von Braun Ian space program.

156
00:18:22,19 --> 00:18:27,12
Was this idea of you know we were going to space and you would sit in you know couch

157
00:18:27,13 --> 00:18:35,09
and watch the expensive space program as we take your tax dollars and we go into space and.

158
00:18:35,09 --> 00:18:45,11
That was sort of a command economy a national controlled space program the Soviets had when we had one.

159
00:18:45,11 --> 00:18:50,46
The other way of looking at space is what I call the Sega Knights see the von Braun eons

160
00:18:50,5 --> 00:18:52,8
and you have the Sega Knights the Sega knights were you know billions

161
00:18:52,81 --> 00:18:59,86
and billions of stars look at this incredible universe isn't a ground isn't a great look at God's handiwork spread out

162
00:18:59,87 --> 00:19:03,36
in the sky look at it but don't touch it.

163
00:19:03,36 --> 00:19:06,49
Right now that's astronomy things like that and I love that

164
00:19:06,87 --> 00:19:10,72
but it was very much hands off most people don't realize at the beginning back

165
00:19:10,73 --> 00:19:18,99
when Dr O'Neill a starting call second didn't believe that civilians could should go into space he was against it he

166
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:24,69
actually disliked Dr O'Neill he called Dr O'Neill the robber baron who wanted to plunder

167
00:19:24,7 --> 00:19:29,00
and pillage God's pristine solar system.

168
00:19:29,00 --> 00:19:32,77
And then there's Dr Neil he was the third category

169
00:19:33,65 --> 00:19:39,46
and he didn't have a funny voice he didn't have a funny accent he did have a Beatle haircut which he always had to

170
00:19:39,47 --> 00:19:46,67
until the end of his life but he was a very very gentle man and he basically said Take your dreams your imaginations

171
00:19:46,68 --> 00:20:00,14
and your tools and use the resources of space to expand civilization. Open the high frontier. Why was it so. Because I.

172
00:20:00,2 --> 00:20:01,93
Wasn't it was Dr

173
00:20:01,94 --> 00:20:09,56
and his message was appealing to me because I wasn't an astronaut because I was just a guy I'm just a kid from Texas

174
00:20:09,57 --> 00:20:18,79
who'd grown up in England and you know I was just a kid I'll start that again if you want. Dr and his message.

175
00:20:18,79 --> 00:20:24,33
Was so appealing to me because I wasn't an astronaut.

176
00:20:24,33 --> 00:20:31,8
I was just a kid I was just a guy you know just a normal human being who had a set of skills that maybe hadn't been

177
00:20:31,81 --> 00:20:36,8
honed by being a physicist or an astronomer or an engineer

178
00:20:37,31 --> 00:20:44,4
and yet what he was saying was that I could participate that I just like the astronauts just like the engineers just

179
00:20:44,41 --> 00:20:54,43
like the astronomers and the physicists I had the right stuff. And that gave me an opening. And you know.

180
00:20:54,43 --> 00:21:02,9
If you believe that you can make a contribution something if you believe that you can add value to something that you

181
00:21:02,91 --> 00:21:08,3
can take whatever skills that you have and you can participate in something and that thing is grand and exciting

182
00:21:08,31 --> 00:21:10,83
and inspiring.

183
00:21:10,83 --> 00:21:12,47
You should always step or do it

184
00:21:13,32 --> 00:21:22,11
and they called the force the other important point was the kindness of the people involved they let me participate

185
00:21:22,52 --> 00:21:26,45
here was this crazy guy who.

186
00:21:26,45 --> 00:21:33,09
You know obviously talks too much this is very excited about it and I showed up and I volunteered

187
00:21:33,13 --> 00:21:41,34
and I offered to you know I'll sweep the floor with if you want just let me in just let me let me do this.

188
00:21:41,34 --> 00:21:52,03
I started in New York City. Let me back up here and start again OK so.

189
00:21:52,03 --> 00:21:58,37
One of the other moments that occurred was I took a course about becoming myself.

190
00:22:00,2 --> 00:22:06,21
I took a course it was I took a course called Best at the time and it was a big controversy all

191
00:22:06,22 --> 00:22:15,39
but it kind of broke open my psychology a little bit. So I took this this course and it helped me.

192
00:22:15,39 --> 00:22:20,3
Realize that I had more potential than I thought I did.

193
00:22:20,3 --> 00:22:28,49
Three months after the course I ended up even though I thought it hadn't helped me at all I ended up married living in

194
00:22:28,5 --> 00:22:34,46
Manhattan and making the decision that I was going to change my life.

195
00:22:34,46 --> 00:22:43,19
I remember when evening sitting on one of the piers in the Hudson River. I just got a New York City.

196
00:22:43,19 --> 00:22:52,92
And looking up at the sky and just thinking. I want to do something important. Now at the time my skill set.

197
00:22:52,92 --> 00:22:54,72
Wasn't physics or science

198
00:22:54,73 --> 00:23:00,33
and I was trying to figure out what I was going to do I've literally thought it one point I would make great movies

199
00:23:00,34 --> 00:23:03,37
that would get people excited about space.

200
00:23:03,37 --> 00:23:11,1
I was just feeling around trying to find a way to tell because I knew I wanted to do this so one of the things I did

201
00:23:11,11 --> 00:23:21,37
was I started The New York five society. Being a place in space where you would build a colony.

202
00:23:21,37 --> 00:23:25,7
And we went to the people at the Intrepid aircraft carrier museum

203
00:23:26,58 --> 00:23:33,04
and we asked them if we could start having a monthly meeting so I started putting on these monthly meetings at the

204
00:23:33,05 --> 00:23:36,92
Intrepid aircraft carrier all about space.

205
00:23:36,92 --> 00:23:44,72
And we would invite important people to come and give lectures and I would go to dinner with those people before

206
00:23:44,73 --> 00:23:49,12
and I would hang out with them afterwards and they would get to know me and I would get to know them

207
00:23:49,13 --> 00:23:55,47
and I would have their contact information and and I would learn from them.

208
00:23:55,47 --> 00:24:00,17
And at the same time I was building an organization and we started to grow.

209
00:24:00,76 --> 00:24:07,28
And we started to really look at how we could influence the political system

210
00:24:07,51 --> 00:24:17,43
and how we could influence people to make this happen at one point. In the late eighty's.

211
00:24:17,43 --> 00:24:24,43
While I was working for Dr O'Neill's Institute which was the Space Studies Institute.

212
00:24:24,43 --> 00:24:29,61
My SO seats and I decided that we need to be a little more radical.

213
00:24:29,61 --> 00:24:35,91
We needed to do more than just do research we needed to do more than just have great meetings.

214
00:24:35,91 --> 00:24:43,99
The space program was off track it wasn't going the way we had thought Keep in mind before the space shuttle flew we

215
00:24:44,00 --> 00:24:46,57
were promised it was going to fly fifty times a year

216
00:24:47,25 --> 00:24:52,5
when it started to fly the maximum I think it ever flew was around five times in one year

217
00:24:53,12 --> 00:25:00,92
and rather than it being only one hundred dollars to get into space it was ten thousand dollars there was no way we

218
00:25:00,93 --> 00:25:09,07
were going to be able to open the frontier with those kind of costs. I remember sitting at one point.

219
00:25:09,07 --> 00:25:14,27
In a bar in Princeton site.

220
00:25:14,27 --> 00:25:20,85
I remember sitting at one in one lit up I remember sitting at one point in a bar in Princeton with my friends at one of

221
00:25:20,86 --> 00:25:23,52
Dr O'Neill's conferences.

222
00:25:23,52 --> 00:25:30,39
And we were a merry band having a good time and we started talking about how we were going to make this happen.

223
00:25:30,39 --> 00:25:32,88
And I remember us.

224
00:25:32,88 --> 00:25:37,78
My friends who founded the International Space University and myself and some of the others who went off

225
00:25:37,79 --> 00:25:45,51
and did political things. Pledging myself pledging our lives and fortunes.

226
00:25:45,51 --> 00:25:52,02
To helping humanity break out of the planet Earth in our lifetimes and we toasted.

227
00:25:52,02 --> 00:25:55,27
One of the guys called it a benign conspiracy

228
00:25:55,28 --> 00:25:59,65
and I said That sounds like a cancerous tumor maybe we should call it a benevolent conspiracy.

229
00:26:00,51 --> 00:26:08,26
So OK benevolent conspiracy to this day almost every person that was sitting at that table.

230
00:26:08,26 --> 00:26:14,98
Has stayed in the revolution as we call it and he's making it happen. Just from the X.

231
00:26:14,99 --> 00:26:23,79
Prize to people building spacecraft to people that actually change the laws so that one must can ship as those could

232
00:26:23,8 --> 00:26:37,79
fly they're still in the fight. So you became a. Space Africa or maybe space cowboy.

233
00:26:37,79 --> 00:26:47,87
I didn't enter this field with the idea that I was going to have to help. Create in a way a revolution.

234
00:26:47,87 --> 00:26:58,92
It wasn't my plan. I remember at one point. Testifying in front of the commission.

235
00:26:58,92 --> 00:27:03,52
That the way we were going to open space was that NASA needed more support

236
00:27:04,04 --> 00:27:11,07
and we needed to have more astronauts on talk shows. And that would change everything.

237
00:27:11,07 --> 00:27:20,89
Sorry about that and to do that again and again so you became a space I forget or my interactions or space cowboy.

238
00:27:20,89 --> 00:27:29,37
You could call it a cowboy I've been called I've been called cowboy gunslinger.

239
00:27:29,37 --> 00:27:38,59
And if you were worse things by people that I've had to take on to make what is happening now happen.

240
00:27:38,59 --> 00:27:43,84
My joke was that since I don't get paid I may as well have a great image to deal with.

241
00:27:43,84 --> 00:27:51,31
Space Cowboy I've been called a pirate I mean there's there's a lot of different words that people apply to us.

242
00:27:51,31 --> 00:28:00,17
In the end the word I'd like to have applied is effective. We made the change happen. You know.

243
00:28:00,8 --> 00:28:09,86
In one thousand nine hundred five I was I got to sit in front of Congress and do you want to cut and.

244
00:28:09,86 --> 00:28:18,45
Go with your questions because I'm Yeah you know Maggie I try and pausing at a break but yeah you don't charge OK.

245
00:28:18,45 --> 00:28:22,09
Let me go to you so you.

246
00:28:22,09 --> 00:28:27,03
You were talking about that you had this organization and all those people are still going to say Sion

247
00:28:27,35 --> 00:28:34,03
but what do you want to make why do you want to make colonies in space I mean we have a lot of space here

248
00:28:34,04 --> 00:28:42,15
and I heard you could say Earth pretty well why you would want to go out to outer space.

249
00:28:42,15 --> 00:28:54,56
There are several reasons that I've dedicated my life to making this happen. It is my personal. Existential belief.

250
00:28:54,56 --> 00:29:06,52
Is the reason I believe I am here. To help life and humanity expand into the universe and why is that important.

251
00:29:06,52 --> 00:29:21,81
When my first answer would be why isn't that important but I believe. That. Human beings. Know when to change that.

252
00:29:21,81 --> 00:29:31,49
I declare. In other words whether this is a belief whether I'm right whether I'm wrong doesn't really matter. So.

253
00:29:31,49 --> 00:29:39,9
Let's And that's not yes take that again so why isn't why why why you know why we go into space is is a question we get

254
00:29:39,91 --> 00:29:46,77
a lot and I believe it is our job I believe it is our job on several levels I believe that

255
00:29:46,89 --> 00:29:54,72
when it relates to the universe we are the way the universe knows of itself we are the sensing mechanism by which the

256
00:29:54,73 --> 00:29:59,87
universe has consciousness we create the universe.

257
00:30:01,07 --> 00:30:13,02
Just as the universe created us so it could be created by us we are the means by which an entity that we call the

258
00:30:13,03 --> 00:30:18,41
universe which doesn't even exist until we call it into existence by naming it the universe

259
00:30:18,71 --> 00:30:25,95
and giving it certain characteristics we are the entity by by which Are we the mechanism by which that entity knows of

260
00:30:25,96 --> 00:30:33,34
itself that's number one number two. We are alive.

261
00:30:33,34 --> 00:30:39,21
Without living things in my believe the universe would expand

262
00:30:39,22 --> 00:30:45,8
and evolve into maybe equally charged particles an equal distance apart for ever and ever and on

263
00:30:46,05 --> 00:30:55,73
and nothing entropy as they call it into nothingness we go into space. Because we.

264
00:30:55,73 --> 00:31:05,28
Represent life and I believe that it is the duty of life to move into places where there is no life.

265
00:31:05,28 --> 00:31:16,5
And we human beings are the seed carriers we are the beings on this planet that have the capability to carry life

266
00:31:16,51 --> 00:31:26,44
itself into space the beauty of what we are engaged in right now as far as expanding into space is that after the

267
00:31:26,45 --> 00:31:34,63
entire history of humanity being one in which human civilization seems to have attacked what we call the ecosystem as

268
00:31:34,64 --> 00:31:39,96
we developed our technology and our civilization is that we were versing that process

269
00:31:40,58 --> 00:31:48,95
and for the first time in human civilization rather than the expansion of our technology meaning an attack on let's

270
00:31:48,96 --> 00:31:56,47
call it the ecosystem the expansion of our technology be on the earth means we can expand the a consistent because

271
00:31:56,48 --> 00:32:04,98
we're going to carry life with us. That that's. We're going to carry a life into you.

272
00:32:04,98 --> 00:32:13,9
You know I have this organization called new worlds and our logo is a green hand. For the galaxy.

273
00:32:13,9 --> 00:32:24,28
That's on purpose because we believe that our job as human beings is to carry life where there is no life our slogan is

274
00:32:24,29 --> 00:32:29,42
to carry the light of life to places now dark the seeds of life the place is now dead in the eyes hands

275
00:32:29,43 --> 00:32:35,48
and imaginations of humanity to places unseen untouched and unexplored.

276
00:32:35,48 --> 00:32:44,66
That's what I'm about that's my life's mission in a sense and in one paragraph. And she's also in sort of X.

277
00:32:45,16 --> 00:32:54,27
Lloyd's Let's say that asteroids that matter you know.

278
00:32:54,27 --> 00:33:01,5
It's very easy to have abstract conversations about wow let's go into space and let's do all these amazing things

279
00:33:01,68 --> 00:33:11,22
but at the end of the day somebody has to pay for it at the end of the day it has to be able to pay for itself so yeah

280
00:33:11,23 --> 00:33:14,38
I could have amazing dreams of what the future is going to look like

281
00:33:14,39 --> 00:33:21,41
and what it should look light so I can little I could have amazing dreams of what our future in space could

282
00:33:21,42 --> 00:33:23,47
or should look like.

283
00:33:23,47 --> 00:33:29,75
But my attitude is I have to make it happen in the way I have to make it happen is I have to make it pay for itself

284
00:33:30,54 --> 00:33:39,15
and the way to make it pay for itself is to create a business to create an economic infrastructure in which wealth is

285
00:33:39,16 --> 00:33:46,97
generated by. What we're doing in space. But you know there is a sort of a shift.

286
00:33:46,97 --> 00:33:54,25
Looking towards place you know I mean we're doing that for since the fifty's for the last century

287
00:33:54,82 --> 00:34:07,56
but somehow it feels as if there's a change you sort of describe what is changing. What's happening now.

288
00:34:07,56 --> 00:34:17,12
Is scary what's happening now is the transition from. Space being dominated by governments.

289
00:34:17,12 --> 00:34:25,21
And being approached as a place where they carry out their programs to space being seen as a place where people who are

290
00:34:25,22 --> 00:34:37,13
inspired by those programs are able to go out and make things happen in other words. The children of Apollo.

291
00:34:37,13 --> 00:34:40,36
The children who were inspired by Apollo and Soyuz

292
00:34:40,4 --> 00:34:46,33
and the Cold War space program have now grown up with those dreams inside of them

293
00:34:47,02 --> 00:34:56,6
and they're going out to open the front here and these children of Apollo are very pragmatic.

294
00:34:56,6 --> 00:35:04,57
They're business oriented they're creative and they're using the incredible technologies we have today to go out

295
00:35:04,58 --> 00:35:20,34
and make it happen. You know how slow your company is. On them it's future forming what one.

296
00:35:20,34 --> 00:35:27,53
Might my company deep space industries are going to come at this from one angle in another my company I founded deep

297
00:35:27,54 --> 00:35:31,3
space industries. Because.

298
00:35:31,3 --> 00:35:36,75
In a sense out of my Texas heritage you have to be able to walk the walk if you're going to talk the talk I've been

299
00:35:36,76 --> 00:35:38,37
talking the talk for a long time

300
00:35:38,38 --> 00:35:44,74
and in the case in this case walking the walk means going out making it actually happen deep space industries is

301
00:35:44,75 --> 00:35:49,33
focused on harvesting the resources of space.

302
00:35:49,33 --> 00:35:58,18
Because we can use the resources of space we have an unlimited future out there think of it this way.

303
00:35:58,18 --> 00:36:00,13
If I have to carry everything with me.

304
00:36:00,27 --> 00:36:09,99
From the Earth in the space that I need to do anything I will always be limited by the cost of carrying those things

305
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:21,06
from the Earth's surface if on the other hand I can utilize what I find in space the metals the water the materials the

306
00:36:21,07 --> 00:36:23,7
energy that's in space itself coming from the sun

307
00:36:24,38 --> 00:36:30,68
and if I can use those things to do what I'm going to do in space where I'm going to live there whether I'm going to

308
00:36:30,69 --> 00:36:40,96
create an industry there whatever it is a new economy. Then I'm unlimited then I'm released. The Earth.

309
00:36:40,96 --> 00:36:46,73
Sorry I'm sorry when we're on the earth we sit at the bottom of a gravity well.

310
00:36:46,73 --> 00:36:54,05
And that gravity well is the reason that we have to build such large rockets.

311
00:36:54,05 --> 00:36:58,61
If you'll notice when you look at a rocket there's this gigantic.

312
00:36:58,61 --> 00:37:06,64
Engine or set of engines and then there's this little tiny thing at the top which is the payload or the astronauts.

313
00:37:06,64 --> 00:37:15,04
That's because it takes so much energy to lift ourselves off the planet into space why not.

314
00:37:15,04 --> 00:37:16,12
Be out in space

315
00:37:16,13 --> 00:37:22,84
and utilize what we have out there rather than having to take all of that energy to lift ourselves out of the gravity

316
00:37:22,85 --> 00:37:35,03
well. Sorry. Go ahead and then you create machines that actually mine they're going to asteroid those.

317
00:37:35,03 --> 00:37:48,66
I'm sorry you asked me again. OK So then you create machines or ideas about machines that are able to dig into us. Yes.

318
00:37:48,66 --> 00:37:54,95
The resources of space are basically limitless So if we can get out there

319
00:37:55,55 --> 00:38:07,22
and mind asteroids harbors space resources maybe is a better way to. But it. Then we are unbounded from the earth.

320
00:38:07,22 --> 00:38:16,61
Then all we need to do is send people and some small machines and we can start expanding in space. You know.

321
00:38:16,61 --> 00:38:22,97
It's interesting with some it's interesting with the space because our goal is eventually to support the expansion of

322
00:38:23,01 --> 00:38:24,33
humanity into space

323
00:38:25,15 --> 00:38:32,7
but to be pragmatic about it the first thing we're going to send out there is robot very very small robots in many

324
00:38:32,71 --> 00:38:37,42
cases that will be able to tell us what resources we're finding on asteroids

325
00:38:37,43 --> 00:38:45,27
and eventually robots that will help that will go out and begin mining the resources from those asteroids.

326
00:38:45,27 --> 00:38:52,8
That allows us to keep costs very low as far as how we're extracting those resources

327
00:38:53,14 --> 00:39:04,46
and allows us to begin building our industrial base out there. So you know what's there yeah so.

328
00:39:04,46 --> 00:39:10,23
So much slip into deep space mode D.S.I. Mode for now and here it's going to go corporate I know.

329
00:39:10,23 --> 00:39:19,25
So the goal of deep deep space industries is to harvest sun The goal of the Space Industries is to prospect for find

330
00:39:20,15 --> 00:39:27,49
harvest process and utilize space resources.

331
00:39:27,49 --> 00:39:34,81
Our first missions are going to be within the next two years to test our spacecraft in Earth orbit we're working with

332
00:39:34,82 --> 00:39:38,68
the government of Luxembourg to build what we call prospector X.

333
00:39:39,15 --> 00:39:46,26
Which will show us the different technologies demonstrate the technologies that we plan to utilize to go out to the

334
00:39:46,27 --> 00:39:56,35
asteroids prospect rocks actually has a motor that is a steam engine a very ancient technology where heating up water

335
00:39:56,46 --> 00:40:00,17
in the steam goes this way the rocket goes that way it's a very.

336
00:40:00,26 --> 00:40:05,12
The what I would call front to read technology because it's so basic.

337
00:40:05,12 --> 00:40:08,91
And since the main material they were looking to harvest room

338
00:40:08,95 --> 00:40:17,21
and the asteroids in their first phase is water makes perfect sense that we're creating the technology that will

339
00:40:17,22 --> 00:40:28,18
utilize that water to allow us to get around in other words. We're creating the market. By having people use a motor.

340
00:40:28,18 --> 00:40:40,21
That has water as its main power supply. That will then. Be fed into by what it is we harvest which is ice.

341
00:40:40,21 --> 00:40:47,77
And we commit this from commodities because it it's interesting it somehow relates to the story of this early settlers

342
00:40:47,86 --> 00:40:50,43
using the stuff that's there.

343
00:40:50,43 --> 00:40:57,56
And one of the key things about being able to open a frontier is being able to live off the land.

344
00:40:57,56 --> 00:41:00,85
You simply can't go into a frontier

345
00:41:00,89 --> 00:41:08,78
and subtle front here if everything you need there has to come from where you came from.

346
00:41:08,78 --> 00:41:11,59
So that's why you need to go your mind

347
00:41:11,79 --> 00:41:19,01
and then you write the goal of deep space is to help accelerate the opening of the frontier by providing resources in

348
00:41:19,02 --> 00:41:27,62
space. So that we can dramatically decrease the cost of doing things out there.

349
00:41:27,62 --> 00:41:39,68
Could you describe somehow suppose we're living let's say twenty maybe thirty else from now what do you expect it to be.

350
00:41:39,68 --> 00:41:47,18
I would say within the next twenty years there are going to be people living in space in other words the place they are

351
00:41:47,19 --> 00:41:52,58
in space is what they're going to consider their home settlers.

352
00:41:52,58 --> 00:41:59,51
I believe we're going to have industries starting to develop in space that might include space solar power systems.

353
00:42:00,89 --> 00:42:05,86
But certainly I believe strongly that there are going to be people living on Mars

354
00:42:06,43 --> 00:42:12,97
and I believe that our organization our company deep space is going to be operating out there in building large

355
00:42:12,98 --> 00:42:24,56
infrastructure items such as space systems that can be used. To the I went off the deep and.

356
00:42:24,56 --> 00:42:31,57
Well that's an example my sense of what you tried to sort of imagine thirty years from now so what would I see what

357
00:42:31,94 --> 00:42:40,64
would I do just in on I as well you know within thirty years probably for about the cost of your house you'll be able

358
00:42:40,65 --> 00:42:42,84
to go live on Mars or the moon

359
00:42:43,38 --> 00:42:49,13
and probably end a colony that somebody is building in what I call free space in other words the place between the moon

360
00:42:49,31 --> 00:42:52,54
Earth and Mars.

361
00:42:52,54 --> 00:43:00,62
New Civilization is going to be starting now any other time that would be crazy talk but

362
00:43:00,63 --> 00:43:05,66
when you look at what's happening now with companies like mine where we're going to mine

363
00:43:05,67 --> 00:43:10,6
and harvest resources from asteroids when you have any Elon Musk when you have a basis

364
00:43:10,61 --> 00:43:14,33
when you have a Richard Branson you have these other people coming online

365
00:43:15,25 --> 00:43:21,57
when you have the advance in technology that's happening as quickly as it is right now.

366
00:43:21,57 --> 00:43:26,35
This is really going to happen and it's going to happen it probably yeah in the next fifteen to twenty

367
00:43:26,36 --> 00:43:37,07
or thirty years absolutely but why now. We're at a moment in time.

368
00:43:37,07 --> 00:43:44,92
Where we have an intersection in the technologies and the capability.

369
00:43:44,92 --> 00:43:52,8
And the imagination to be able to break out into space we have technologies that were developed in the Cold War the

370
00:43:52,84 --> 00:44:00,89
years it was an incredible thing to me the very same technologies that we developed in the Cold War. I.C.B.M.

371
00:44:00,9 --> 00:44:06,4
Rockets computers to calculate how you could kill the most people

372
00:44:06,41 --> 00:44:16,2
or guide the rockets to their locations the means of communications all of these things that we created to attack each

373
00:44:16,21 --> 00:44:22,6
other on this planet are the very same technologies that have come together now to allow us to leave this planet

374
00:44:22,78 --> 00:44:37,28
and expand into the universe. And you think it is let's see. Humanity into space it's our goal it's our destiny.

375
00:44:37,28 --> 00:44:41,64
I think it is the destiny of the human race to expand our civilization

376
00:44:41,65 --> 00:44:48,04
and life itself into the universe it's why we are here it is why I am here this is my job

377
00:44:48,54 --> 00:44:52,88
and the job of my associates and my friends who are building rockets and space companies

378
00:44:52,92 --> 00:44:56,48
and things like that to make it happen.

379
00:44:56,48 --> 00:45:03,56
You probably must have heard the arguments OK we're making a mass here so then we go out into space make a mess there.

380
00:45:03,56 --> 00:45:11,73
Why do we go to space if we have so many problems here on the earth exactly every time we move into a new frontier

381
00:45:11,74 --> 00:45:17,35
every time we push beyond the place we are we discover more things about that place

382
00:45:17,36 --> 00:45:21,52
and ourselves that we can apply to the civilization to the place we come from

383
00:45:21,65 --> 00:45:30,66
and make it better every time that humanity has moved into a new place whether it means going up the coast of Africa as

384
00:45:30,67 --> 00:45:35,49
primal creatures and beginning to become human beings

385
00:45:35,5 --> 00:45:39,28
and create civilizations whether it means the Greeks moving this way

386
00:45:39,29 --> 00:45:46,76
or that way whether it's China coming out of its boundaries or the the early settlers coming across the ocean

387
00:45:46,88 --> 00:45:51,81
or the people before them that came across the Bering Straits and began to settle in North

388
00:45:51,82 --> 00:46:00,17
and South America every time we move into new places we get better we become better at being human beings and.

389
00:46:00,2 --> 00:46:06,31
I think especially. I think especially in the current era.

390
00:46:06,31 --> 00:46:15,67
Where we have the ability to look back at the mistakes we've made you know the awareness of history that we have now is

391
00:46:15,68 --> 00:46:23,65
probably is absolutely greater than we've ever had in the history of humanity I'm sorry the awareness of history that

392
00:46:23,66 --> 00:46:26,67
we have at this moment in time.

393
00:46:26,67 --> 00:46:35,45
Is the very thing that will allow us to move into the future in a way where we can minimize the mistakes of the past.

394
00:46:35,45 --> 00:46:42,35
It's a very exciting time it's a very wonderful time to be alive if you think about now look if you look at the media

395
00:46:42,36 --> 00:46:50,66
and you believe the stories we feed ourselves the things are terrible you know the planets falling apart we're always

396
00:46:50,67 --> 00:46:56,05
different things. Yes we have to take care of planet Earth.

397
00:46:56,05 --> 00:47:02,21
This is all about life this is all about Planet Earth I am a tree hugger.

398
00:47:02,21 --> 00:47:04,85
OK I'm a Texas tree Argus I'm a tree hugger with a gun

399
00:47:05,2 --> 00:47:15,11
but I am a tree hugger I'm an environmentalist I love planet earth I love life I love things that grow I want to see

400
00:47:15,12 --> 00:47:19,79
that expand I want to see us create new possibilities.

401
00:47:19,79 --> 00:47:28,43
We can only do that if we begin to look at new places if we begin to go into new places you know the environmental

402
00:47:28,44 --> 00:47:31,96
movement on the earth may not have been started by it

403
00:47:32,00 --> 00:47:37,44
but it was certainly given a boost by the first time they look back at the Earth from space.

404
00:47:37,44 --> 00:47:43,87
Because it gives us a context because it gives us an understanding that we live on this tiny little blue marble

405
00:47:44,11 --> 00:47:47,82
floating in this incredible void.

406
00:47:47,82 --> 00:47:55,25
Just this place we call the universe we look at this little tiny blue marble and we go oh my gosh.

407
00:47:55,25 --> 00:48:00,00
You know we were precious life is precious so yeah we have.

408
00:48:00,2 --> 00:48:06,45
I'm here on Earth and guess what we're going to have problems when we go into space we're not going to get.

409
00:48:06,45 --> 00:48:11,98
We're not suddenly going to be become perfect by moving into space there's not going to be some incredible utopia

410
00:48:11,99 --> 00:48:20,46
but where do we go on the earth to try the next thing where do you go on the earth right now to create a new

411
00:48:20,47 --> 00:48:27,32
civilization where do you go on earth to try the next thing that follows democracy that isn't owned by somebody else

412
00:48:27,57 --> 00:48:36,36
where do we go to try new ways of interacting with our fellow human beings where do we go to explore new ideas you know

413
00:48:36,37 --> 00:48:43,81
you need an edge without an edge the center comes apart we have to have an edge we have to have a place where people

414
00:48:43,82 --> 00:48:48,05
who are maybe a little different can do new things.

415
00:48:48,05 --> 00:48:53,66
It's almost as if space will be the next laboratory for human civilization we're going to go into space we're going to

416
00:48:53,67 --> 00:49:00,11
try different ways of creating an economy different ways of acquiring knowledge different ways of acting with each

417
00:49:00,12 --> 00:49:07,44
other I'm excited by it I think it's incredible and you know what I'm not going to like everything they do out there.

418
00:49:07,44 --> 00:49:16,6
And that's just fine because as we go out there were to learn so much more about ourselves. So I said let's go.

419
00:49:16,6 --> 00:49:27,44
Settlers have me that's what you want to call on us becoming the she's distributing ourselves over to you you know that

420
00:49:27,94 --> 00:49:31,77
I. Think.

421
00:49:31,77 --> 00:49:38,63
I sometimes have trouble with the word destiny because it sounds like it's just going to happen no matter what you do.

422
00:49:38,63 --> 00:49:42,42
This is an active process what we're doing

423
00:49:42,43 --> 00:49:49,32
and trying to break the human species out beyond the Earth is an act of creation we have to make it happen there's no

424
00:49:49,33 --> 00:49:56,29
guarantee it's going to happen and so when I hear the word it's our destiny to go into space.

425
00:49:56,29 --> 00:50:00,17
I don't know if it's something we need to do something we have to do something.

426
00:50:00,39 --> 00:50:00,92
Should do

427
00:50:01,3 --> 00:50:08,67
but it isn't preordained that it's going to happen I don't want to ever get lazy about this you know we we could end up

428
00:50:08,68 --> 00:50:19,43
in a civilization that doesn't go out into space. And then we die. You know we kill ourselves.

429
00:50:19,43 --> 00:50:23,68
An asteroid hits the planet and destroys is.

430
00:50:23,68 --> 00:50:29,93
There's so many different things that could go wrong the sun sends out a flare one one day just wipes us out with a

431
00:50:29,94 --> 00:50:35,55
little flame and there's so many things that can go wrong.

432
00:50:35,55 --> 00:50:43,92
We have an ant's understanding of the universe around us you know.

433
00:50:43,92 --> 00:50:51,79
How does an ant understand the bottom of the shoe that stepson it and has no comprehension of.

434
00:50:51,79 --> 00:50:52,29
A foot

435
00:50:52,33 --> 00:51:01,07
and a shoe that crushes it we have no comprehension of what could be out there in the solar system in the galaxy

436
00:51:01,08 --> 00:51:11,33
or in the universe that could wipe us out like that. Now some might say well then why bother to do anything.

437
00:51:11,33 --> 00:51:24,03
My attitude is no human beings are pretty cool life is great living systems this amazing planet we're on is pretty cool.

438
00:51:24,03 --> 00:51:30,52
I want to see it live I want to see it expand.

439
00:51:30,52 --> 00:51:38,57
You could also say oh people could also say well very long it's a nice dream.

440
00:51:38,57 --> 00:51:43,88
This is all about dreams and it's all right this is all about dreams

441
00:51:44,15 --> 00:51:53,84
and it's about making dreams happen you know I could sit on the couch and run my television.

442
00:51:53,84 --> 00:51:59,98
And I could just get lost in dreams or I could do my video game and just get lost in dreams.

443
00:52:01,06 --> 00:52:02,56
That may be fine for some people

444
00:52:02,92 --> 00:52:07,76
and it's not good enough for me I have to create something I have to make something happen I have to help create a

445
00:52:07,77 --> 00:52:18,65
future I believe that's why we're here you know if I make no contribution to making something happen to moving myself

446
00:52:18,66 --> 00:52:19,41
my life

447
00:52:19,76 --> 00:52:32,46
and my society's life forward I may as well be Iraq I may as well be a Bush you know I I believe it's why we're here.

448
00:52:32,46 --> 00:52:43,65
We're not human beings are by our very nature not passive We don't just exist to exist that's wonderful it's very Zen

449
00:52:43,66 --> 00:52:50,68
like and believe me I have a deep understanding and I'm always a student of things like Zen

450
00:52:51,2 --> 00:53:06,69
and the way of just going with the flow..

451
00:52:55,29 --> 00:53:04,37
But I'm also a human being and I have a dream and I'm dedicating my life to make it happen. I have settlers D.N.A.

452
00:53:06,69 --> 00:53:11,75
I'm like. We all have the D.N.A.

453
00:53:11,76 --> 00:53:15,64
Have Explorers and settlers It's whether we choose to act on it

454
00:53:15,65 --> 00:53:27,27
or not that counts that's the difference it's the simple act in a moment a decision that occurs in just a moment.

455
00:53:27,27 --> 00:53:30,16
Of taking an action.

456
00:53:30,16 --> 00:53:36,28
That moment we do it every day we either do something that moves us forward we do something that changes our future

457
00:53:36,69 --> 00:53:44,15
or we don't and we make those decisions moment by moment every day I have chosen to try

458
00:53:44,16 --> 00:53:47,08
and create a better future I have chosen

459
00:53:47,34 --> 00:53:56,59
and taken the stand that I believe it is my job to create that does to me to make that future happen in which we have

460
00:53:56,6 --> 00:54:00,17
expanded beyond the Earth that's what I do that.

461
00:54:00,29 --> 00:54:07,21
What my friends who are building these rockets building these companies making these things happen they believe it to

462
00:54:07,44 --> 00:54:10,36
they're here to do that too.

463
00:54:10,36 --> 00:54:16,48
Now we could take a different approach and I could take a different approach in life and just watch science fiction

464
00:54:16,49 --> 00:54:27,39
and play video games I've chosen to take those things that I see and make them happen. That's nice.

465
00:54:27,39 --> 00:54:36,11
Ask me OK so how would those colonies in space and to what one already.

466
00:54:36,11 --> 00:54:39,35
Know basic space colony whether it's the moon Mars

467
00:54:39,36 --> 00:54:45,3
or free space has some things you have to be able to have air water food

468
00:54:45,9 --> 00:54:52,25
but the basic principles that we deal with here you know you have to have protection in space however from radiation

469
00:54:52,49 --> 00:54:58,22
radiation in space is very dangerous cosmic rays are one of our biggest problems and you see

470
00:54:59,15 --> 00:55:03,13
when we're here on the earth we're protected by a magnetic field.

471
00:55:03,13 --> 00:55:09,95
And it's a very interesting thing because once you go outside of that field cosmic rays they disrupt your D.N.A.

472
00:55:10,52 --> 00:55:10,94
So

473
00:55:10,98 --> 00:55:17,65
when you're in space you're going to have to have a large shield around you you know we have these pictures often of.

474
00:55:17,65 --> 00:55:25,08
Bubbles of glass on Mars and that's really not how it's going to be at first you're going to be under several feet.

475
00:55:25,08 --> 00:55:28,08
Of lunar Martian soil to protect you from radiation

476
00:55:28,09 --> 00:55:37,23
or water ice you need to be you need to make up for the fact that you don't have the radiation belts what we call the

477
00:55:37,24 --> 00:55:39,67
Van Allen Belts I'm struck again on that

478
00:55:40,44 --> 00:55:48,85
when you're in space very make it the Yeah Yeah Yeah so what's rude a space colony to look like space colonies are

479
00:55:48,86 --> 00:55:50,95
basically going to be bubbles of life

480
00:55:51,9 --> 00:55:57,14
and are going to have to be protected from radiation because once you get beyond the Van Allen belts that protect us

481
00:55:57,15 --> 00:56:04,34
here on the earth you're going to have to have something we call. Shielding several feet thick.

482
00:56:04,34 --> 00:56:13,39
And basically it's a closed system you have to generate your own food air water that's the same whether you're on the

483
00:56:13,4 --> 00:56:16,18
moon Mars or in space itself.

484
00:56:16,18 --> 00:56:24,74
Now when you're in space you can build colonies that rotate and that provides you are what we call artificial gravity.

485
00:56:24,74 --> 00:56:30,14
And you can rotate them the same speed at a speed which duplicates the gravity of the earth

486
00:56:30,75 --> 00:56:32,89
when you're on Mars you're stuck with Martian gravity

487
00:56:32,9 --> 00:56:39,22
when you're on the moon you're stuck with the lunar gravity so those people that live there at some point will get to a

488
00:56:39,23 --> 00:56:46,41
point a few generations in where they probably won't be able to come back to the earth.

489
00:56:46,41 --> 00:56:49,98
Space colonies no matter where they are the Moon Mars

490
00:56:49,99 --> 00:56:57,77
or in free space itself have certain basic similarities they have to protect you from radiation they have to provide

491
00:56:57,78 --> 00:57:06,05
you with an atmosphere you have to be able to have food. And you have to be able to have a way to get around.

492
00:57:06,05 --> 00:57:11,12
That's basically it but you also need family life for example was that one of the things of

493
00:57:11,55 --> 00:57:18,37
when you know I was actually sort of shows it as a family life.

494
00:57:18,37 --> 00:57:25,83
Once we get past the very first basic stages of exploration which is kind of where we are.

495
00:57:25,83 --> 00:57:27,3
We have astronauts going out

496
00:57:27,31 --> 00:57:36,27
and coming back we move into the settlement phase which is where people go to live out their lives in this new place

497
00:57:36,28 --> 00:57:43,53
and carve out a future for their next generations you're going to see families growing in space.

498
00:57:43,53 --> 00:57:51,14
And it's going to be very much like the old settlers moving out into the frontier here on Earth.

499
00:57:51,14 --> 00:57:53,62
Children who are going to grow up in space

500
00:57:53,99 --> 00:57:59,45
and think of space as their home you're going to have entire generations growing up in space.

501
00:58:00,2 --> 00:58:07,32
Think of space as their home they're going to have all the skills they're going to know almost at a very intuitive

502
00:58:07,33 --> 00:58:16,09
level that if this thing breaks how to fix it. You know just is the key I know that if you're dealing with kids today.

503
00:58:16,09 --> 00:58:23,5
When you look at the way they interact with technology it blows your mind because the they just automatically know how

504
00:58:23,51 --> 00:58:25,72
to use a videogame or a computer

505
00:58:25,73 --> 00:58:31,77
or things like that they know how to program things that older generations are baffled by

506
00:58:32,05 --> 00:58:37,78
when we get into space it's going to be the same thing they're going to know how to seal a hole in their habitat

507
00:58:37,99 --> 00:58:40,91
they're going to know how to grow a tomato plant

508
00:58:40,92 --> 00:58:48,3
or create food they're going to know these things the same way we know how to cook on a stove or open a refrigerator

509
00:58:48,31 --> 00:58:56,39
or fix a car or operate a camera or a computer it's going to be natural to them.

510
00:58:56,39 --> 00:59:03,00
They're gone be humans in space I mean idiots think thing is if you look at the space colonies of on you know it

511
00:59:03,01 --> 00:59:11,06
somehow resemble fairy much let's say outskirts of our time.

512
00:59:11,06 --> 00:59:19,46
When we look at the way that the colonies are presented to us now again these are mature colonies these are several

513
00:59:19,47 --> 00:59:21,9
years and it's not going to be like that at the very beginning

514
00:59:22,42 --> 00:59:30,38
but I think a lot of it is that we are going to recreate what it is that we have here on the earth hopefully in a in a

515
00:59:30,39 --> 00:59:32,49
better way.

516
00:59:32,49 --> 00:59:40,48
But you're going to have trees and and lakes and birds and flowers and butterflies

517
00:59:40,49 --> 00:59:47,13
and families living in those places that's the goal.

518
00:59:47,13 --> 00:59:55,78
It may not so much but this thread a light hearted bird life we're going to be spreading life it's going to be green

519
00:59:55,79 --> 01:00:00,17
and bright and light I don't want it to look like you know the.

520
01:00:00,39 --> 01:00:05,7
The inside of the spaceship an alien you know it words dark and gloomy and

521
01:00:06,02 --> 01:00:12,9
and all of that I mean that creates a great mood for a Hollywood movie but that's not what we want to do we want air

522
01:00:12,91 --> 01:00:19,49
and bright light we want a place where children can grow up and and be happy

523
01:00:19,5 --> 01:00:22,92
and where families can work together to create new communities

524
01:00:22,93 --> 01:00:30,03
and new civilization that's what we're after it's funny you celebrate it here your own home you're the only one who has

525
01:00:30,16 --> 01:00:43,67
plants front of his house. You know and for me gardening is. To release you know I have.

526
01:00:43,67 --> 01:00:52,11
Sorry for me gardening is a bit of a release I am very very caught up and what I do. And.

527
01:00:52,11 --> 01:00:54,69
It really is about spreading life into the universe

528
01:00:54,7 --> 01:01:02,79
and there's something to something so it's human about putting your hands in the dirt and planting something

529
01:01:02,8 --> 01:01:07,45
and making it grow there's something so very very human to me in that

530
01:01:07,76 --> 01:01:15,8
and so I have plants all around my place of fish tanks and aquariums and things like that.

531
01:01:15,8 --> 01:01:25,22
A lot of people think of space as being like this cold high tech hard place where people that are working in spaces

532
01:01:25,23 --> 01:01:28,45
being cold engineers and machines

533
01:01:28,46 --> 01:01:34,78
and things like that for me it's not about that at all it's about life that's why I have plants and aquariums

534
01:01:34,79 --> 01:01:37,76
and things like that I'm just I'm a big fan of life

535
01:01:38,74 --> 01:01:45,73
and that's what you like to do gardening in space I would love to garden in space you know I want to plant a tree on

536
01:01:45,74 --> 01:01:50,3
Mars I want to see a butterfly on them and I want to see.

537
01:01:50,3 --> 01:02:00,17
How we can fertilize Sorry but that was it yeah you know that it's a so that's something you would like sort of guy.

538
01:02:00,2 --> 01:02:10,83
And gardening in space I'm about green things I want to see trees on the moon I want to see butterflies on Mars I want

539
01:02:10,84 --> 01:02:20,08
to see just take the better aspects of gardens and life and forests of different kinds

540
01:02:20,09 --> 01:02:25,98
and put them out there into the universe and you know look for me.

541
01:02:25,98 --> 01:02:30,74
Even though one might argue that we are the universe learning about itself

542
01:02:31,01 --> 01:02:37,2
and being the mechanism by which the universe knows of itself there is also that interaction where there are forces in

543
01:02:37,21 --> 01:02:46,44
the universe that are trying to kill us that are trying to kill life not consciously life is an invasion on what you

544
01:02:46,45 --> 01:02:54,32
might call a domain of death in a sense in the universe so I believe that it is our job to spread life to places that

545
01:02:54,33 --> 01:03:04,06
are dead I believe that it is the ultimate actively human being to plant a seed and to grow something living.

546
01:03:04,06 --> 01:03:08,77
That is a reversal of the way we have treated our own planet

547
01:03:09,07 --> 01:03:17,45
and that to me is the shift in what it means to be a human being that is about to occur.

548
01:03:17,45 --> 01:03:23,84
OK Now let's talk about your company because your company executive your company is just.

549
01:03:23,84 --> 01:03:36,02
Well suspending live actually taking. Resources somehow What's the intention of that your company deep space industry.

550
01:03:36,02 --> 01:03:44,41
Deep Space Industries is harvesting space resources we are going out to dead rocks that may

551
01:03:44,42 --> 01:03:48,1
or may not actually someday come on.

552
01:03:48,1 --> 01:03:52,66
The Space Industries is harvesting space resources we're going out to dead rocks

553
01:03:53,25 --> 01:04:00,1
and extracting from those dead rocks water the stuff of life and if we have.

554
01:04:00,2 --> 01:04:09,11
Water we can then have oxygen to breathe we have rocket propellant if we add carbon to the water we have methane

555
01:04:09,3 --> 01:04:17,01
and we can make plastic we can build things we can then take the iron that is available in many of the asteroids

556
01:04:17,23 --> 01:04:21,29
and use it to make things we can then take other metals

557
01:04:21,69 --> 01:04:30,36
and use those things those metals to build other necessities that we might need in space.

558
01:04:30,36 --> 01:04:33,57
As well necessary to bring them to Earth

559
01:04:33,58 --> 01:04:39,53
but actually you know let me be very clear if Space Industries is not going out to mine asteroids

560
01:04:39,54 --> 01:04:46,39
or harvest so I let me be very clear deep space industries is not going out to our best asteroids to bring those

561
01:04:46,4 --> 01:04:56,37
materials back to the earth our goal is to harvest resources for use in space so that those going into space don't have

562
01:04:56,38 --> 01:04:59,78
to carry them with them as they go.

563
01:04:59,78 --> 01:05:08,2
In fact you're preparing space resources for building phase comes we are going deep space industries is going to be

564
01:05:08,21 --> 01:05:14,36
harvesting space resources so that we can build an industrial economy in space

565
01:05:14,72 --> 01:05:19,76
and eventually human settlements be on the earth.

566
01:05:19,76 --> 01:05:21,11
That's an interesting thing ever

567
01:05:21,12 --> 01:05:28,45
but maybe maybe we should make it more a little bit more clear OK because that's actually your providing the stuff that

568
01:05:28,49 --> 01:05:36,14
people are able to settle right OK. So let me come at that from a defining moment.

569
01:05:36,14 --> 01:05:45,8
So what's the aim of your industry you know did space industry's goal is to provide the materials that people will need

570
01:05:45,81 --> 01:05:52,27
to live and settle in space. And what it is.

571
01:05:52,27 --> 01:05:57,76
OK some of the things we're going to be able to provide in the early days are going to be water.

572
01:05:57,76 --> 01:06:03,46
And if you have water you have air. You have rocket propellant.

573
01:06:03,46 --> 01:06:10,05
And then beyond that we're going to provide things like iron which is very easy we believe we can extract it from

574
01:06:10,06 --> 01:06:15,48
asteroids using magnets essentially. When we come back at it.

575
01:06:15,48 --> 01:06:22,5
We can get well you get into a complete story because I think it's interesting to sort of that you are providing really

576
01:06:22,58 --> 01:06:25,94
good resources for space.

577
01:06:25,94 --> 01:06:33,92
OK Deep Space Industries is going to be providing the materials in space for people to build civilization in space in

578
01:06:33,93 --> 01:06:40,3
other words colonies to resupply space ships that are going between the Earth and the moon and Mars

579
01:06:40,31 --> 01:06:46,88
and places like that we're not going out there to mine asteroids to bring that stuff back down to the earth we pretty

580
01:06:46,89 --> 01:06:53,07
well have everything we could bring from an asteroid to the earth already here on the earth after all the earth was

581
01:06:53,08 --> 01:07:01,64
actually created by asteroids you know the Earth is a collection of asteroids that came together in the beginning of

582
01:07:01,98 --> 01:07:09,52
this solar system so it's not like we need to go harvest asteroid materials to bring it down to the earth OK if you're

583
01:07:09,53 --> 01:07:16,68
going to space you have to climb out of this big gravity well we call it to go out there.

584
01:07:16,68 --> 01:07:25,58
I put it this way if you went outside right now and you took a handful of dirt and you lifted it into space.

585
01:07:25,58 --> 01:07:34,94
It would be worth ten thousand dollars just. It's very very expensive to take things into space.

586
01:07:34,94 --> 01:07:41,27
That's an opportunity for deep space industries because we can go out there mine asteroids

587
01:07:41,37 --> 01:07:48,33
and provide those materials to people that are going to space cheaper than they can carry it from the earth.

588
01:07:48,33 --> 01:07:53,48
And that makes it easy. And heads.

589
01:07:53,48 --> 01:08:00,17
If we're going to be opening the frontier we have to be able to have business plans that close in other words we.

590
01:08:00,2 --> 01:08:06,07
We have to be able to show how we're going to make money we have to be able to create an economy.

591
01:08:06,07 --> 01:08:14,87
And some produce space industries being a supply center being in a way says being the people that are giving those who

592
01:08:14,88 --> 01:08:22,21
are going to space you create colonies what they need to build those colonies is our business we are in the business of

593
01:08:22,22 --> 01:08:28,25
supplying the settlers of the future with what they need to go do what they want to do.

594
01:08:28,25 --> 01:08:36,44
What's the time span when will this become reality yeah do you see these industries is falling first spacecraft

595
01:08:36,49 --> 01:08:44,57
and the Deep Space Industries is flying off for a spacecraft in twenty seventeen.

596
01:08:44,57 --> 01:08:52,44
Then by two thousand and twenty we will be putting our first lander on an asteroid it's called Prospect one prospect

597
01:08:52,45 --> 01:08:55,17
or one we'll go to an asteroid in two thousand and twenty

598
01:08:55,8 --> 01:09:01,21
and land so I'm going to start again prospector one will fly out to an asteroid in two thousand and twenty

599
01:09:01,8 --> 01:09:05,63
and basically give us an idea of what that asteroid is made of

600
01:09:06,29 --> 01:09:12,53
and then at the end of its life it's going to actually land on the asteroid so we can learn how the asteroid is made up

601
01:09:12,57 --> 01:09:14,05
of.

602
01:09:14,05 --> 01:09:22,01
People who are in the money business call that dig ability we're going to learn is a pile of gravel is you know how

603
01:09:22,02 --> 01:09:26,96
much of it is solid because we need to know these things if we're going to be harvesting resources we're going to be

604
01:09:26,97 --> 01:09:39,91
mining it. You define missions of you know large ships actually taking and tire asteroid and what is that the future.

605
01:09:39,91 --> 01:09:45,7
When we send out a run through the journey on the whole list and OK so.

606
01:09:45,7 --> 01:09:51,59
After our first test spacecraft in Earth orbit we're going to move on out around two thousand and twenty

607
01:09:51,6 --> 01:09:57,55
and some prospect of one to survey an asteroid or two assaye an asteroid tell us what it's made of

608
01:09:57,87 --> 01:10:00,17
and then to land on it so we'll know the car.

609
01:10:00,3 --> 01:10:08,34
Position is that a gravel pile is a solid rock things like that then we'll be able to compare what it tells us to what

610
01:10:08,35 --> 01:10:11,83
we're learning by looking at other asteroids Now

611
01:10:12,6 --> 01:10:22,52
when we come back I'm sorry looking another restroom cut well after prospector one has shown us what an asteroid is

612
01:10:22,53 --> 01:10:29,32
basically made of relative to what we've seen of them from the earth will now be able to take that data that

613
01:10:29,33 --> 01:10:31,45
information and look at other asteroids

614
01:10:31,77 --> 01:10:40,56
and decide which ones we want to go prospect then we can send out spacecraft that we call harvesters harvesters we'll

615
01:10:40,57 --> 01:10:51,11
go out to asteroids and take pieces of them and bring them back and be able to convert those into hydrogen oxygen

616
01:10:51,18 --> 01:10:59,05
and let me start again on them I'm going to give them a little now I'm getting down to the details into detail.

617
01:10:59,05 --> 01:11:03,02
OK after we send the prospect or spacecraft to examine

618
01:11:03,03 --> 01:11:14,38
and prospect in asteroids we will then send out harvesters they will capture parts of asteroids and bring those back

619
01:11:15,05 --> 01:11:21,9
and from them we'll be able to extract water because we believe most.

620
01:11:21,9 --> 01:11:30,91
Sorry we believe there are a large number of asteroids that contain great amounts of water in the form of ice so if we

621
01:11:30,92 --> 01:11:40,51
look into the future ward it will be diffused sure if your company deep space industry defers industry is goal is to be

622
01:11:40,52 --> 01:11:42,95
the provider.

623
01:11:42,95 --> 01:11:44,39
Of supplies materials

624
01:11:44,4 --> 01:11:52,82
and technology for people operating in space for the companies for the governments people who want to settle space

625
01:11:52,83 --> 01:12:02,54
people who want to explore in space it's going to be always cheaper and easier for them to get. What they need.

626
01:12:02,54 --> 01:12:04,9
From space than to bring it out from the earth

627
01:12:05,14 --> 01:12:12,45
and we intend to be the people that sell it to him it's really look if you're going to open a frontier at the end of

628
01:12:12,46 --> 01:12:18,31
the day you have to be able to pay for yourself to be there to do that you have to have an economy to have an economy

629
01:12:18,32 --> 01:12:20,85
you have to have successful businesses so

630
01:12:20,89 --> 01:12:30,54
when I go from this big cosmic picture down to how do I make it happen now I have to come up with a business plan that

631
01:12:30,58 --> 01:12:38,81
allows me to create a profit so that I can have people employed to actually eventually go out there

632
01:12:38,82 --> 01:12:47,07
and live now we're going to start with robots with deep space and I'll come back to that So I mean but.

633
01:12:47,07 --> 01:12:47,55
So

634
01:12:47,56 --> 01:12:55,85
and that it's easier to really get it in to get it that it's easier to get these results in space than to get them from

635
01:12:55,86 --> 01:13:00,08
the earth. It's.

636
01:13:00,08 --> 01:13:10,32
Been a me you me comment this really I get what you said about one you know out of ground dust which actually is right

637
01:13:10,36 --> 01:13:17,4
right if you carry if you carry a pound of dirt into spaces it's ten thousand dollars to go just as high as the space

638
01:13:17,41 --> 01:13:21,99
station the further you go out the more expensive it gets.

639
01:13:21,99 --> 01:13:33,00
If we can't provide air water metals building materials in space to people are going out there.

640
01:13:33,00 --> 01:13:40,11
And they don't have to carry it with them and then we can begin to create a civilization in space we can be

641
01:13:40,12 --> 01:13:47,14
and to settle space now the first product that we're going to deliver in space is going to be water wide because

642
01:13:47,44 --> 01:13:54,98
asteroids so the first product we're going to be the first product that we're going to deliver in space is going to be

643
01:13:54,99 --> 01:14:00,17
water white because there are a lot of asteroids that have a high water content in the.

644
01:14:00,49 --> 01:14:07,63
Frozen ice and it's fairly easy to extract we just heat the asteroid and capture the steam

645
01:14:07,72 --> 01:14:09,37
and the other gases that come out

646
01:14:09,74 --> 01:14:16,17
and now we can utilize those to do whatever we want if you've got water you've got air.

647
01:14:16,17 --> 01:14:24,66
You've got water you've got propellant in different forms we can capture those things fairly easily in fact you might

648
01:14:24,67 --> 01:14:28,37
say that deep space is going to be the building supplies center the gas station

649
01:14:28,38 --> 01:14:35,66
and the always says for people who are going to carry on other activities in space whether in one Musk is going to Mars

650
01:14:35,67 --> 01:14:38,36
or somebody is going to build a village on the moon

651
01:14:38,37 --> 01:14:44,18
or somebody is going further out into the solar system if they don't have to carry what they need to do that with them

652
01:14:44,22 --> 01:14:49,16
and they can get it into space in space.

653
01:14:49,16 --> 01:14:53,51
If you want Musk is on his way to Mars or somebody is going to build a village on the moon

654
01:14:53,68 --> 01:15:01,07
or somebody is going to go out explore the deep solar system if they can get what they need to go out there from the

655
01:15:01,08 --> 01:15:07,28
supplies that are already being provided in space they can do it a lot more often a lot more cheaply

656
01:15:07,49 --> 01:15:17,3
and they can do a lot more things our goal is to be that gas station that away says that supply depot so that we can

657
01:15:17,34 --> 01:15:31,88
really begin operate in space and do it in a in an ever expanding manner. You ever expect. Sorry you know.

658
01:15:31,88 --> 01:15:40,19
Do I ever expect to be in space myself yeah I'd like to I really would but I don't have to. You know.

659
01:15:40,19 --> 01:15:47,38
If I can walk out into a field at night and see lights on the moon if I can go to a beach maybe here in Texas

660
01:15:47,39 --> 01:15:52,65
and watch a rocket take off that's carrying colonists to Mars I'll be a happy camper.
