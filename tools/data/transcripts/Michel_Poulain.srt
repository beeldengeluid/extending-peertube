1
00:00:01,21 --> 00:00:03,2
So describe your first trip.

2
00:00:04,72 --> 00:00:12,37
So the reason why I came to be like Randy you have to find it a bit earlier this is in one thousand nine hundred ninety

3
00:00:12,38 --> 00:00:15,57
nine we have a meeting in mom per year this is out of friends

4
00:00:15,89 --> 00:00:19,87
and this is a meeting of people dealing with research on longevity

5
00:00:20,53 --> 00:00:30,43
and they are very attentive to validation which means that if these old person are really so all tense all these are

6
00:00:30,44 --> 00:00:36,3
demographic and so margin it isn't and medical doctor so at that meeting you know over ninety nine.

7
00:00:37,62 --> 00:00:40,76
From Sardinia did a presentation

8
00:00:40,85 --> 00:00:48,58
and in this presentation the Explain that in the neural province where we are either in the neural proteins the number

9
00:00:48,59 --> 00:00:49,95
of made centenarian

10
00:00:49,96 --> 00:01:00,37
and female centenarian is about the same we were really skeptical white because all over the world us five six even ten

11
00:01:00,38 --> 00:01:07,88
times more female centenarian compared to maid centenarian So if you have a place where you have the same number it

12
00:01:07,89 --> 00:01:15,49
means that probably the male as exaggerate their age so they declare that they are one hundred

13
00:01:15,5 --> 00:01:19,95
but they are not one hundred so it was clear I remember the coffee break there

14
00:01:20,24 --> 00:01:27,51
and during the coffee Reg They say we need to send somebody to validate to see what happens because it's a removed area

15
00:01:27,52 --> 00:01:35,99
and the Montane there and the person from the Statistical Office of say probably that the data are not existing

16
00:01:36,00 --> 00:01:43,6
or there would be problems and as I was probably the only one as historical demographic there I was volunteer

17
00:01:44,18 --> 00:01:48,96
and so I say I would go there next January so we were in October

18
00:01:49,00 --> 00:02:00,59
and I planned to come twenty of January two thousand and. Wonderful they collect me at the airport in Aguero.

19
00:02:01,85 --> 00:02:03,66
They were there very happy that I will come

20
00:02:03,67 --> 00:02:12,24
and they say we go to a celebration in a village of four centenarian in a village of three thousand a bit

21
00:02:12,25 --> 00:02:17,74
and that was ours are not nearby and OK I say yes I am ready to go

22
00:02:18,3 --> 00:02:26,9
but how can I congratulate this person if I will say just after that they are false OK So I say before to go to the

23
00:02:27,56 --> 00:02:29,47
community I want to go to the municipal

24
00:02:29,48 --> 00:02:34,97
or to see the document if if at least if they exist so we went quickly to the municipal

25
00:02:35,51 --> 00:02:45,4
and they show me that there exist they show me even the birth records of these persons I say OK at least if even if I

26
00:02:45,41 --> 00:02:51,69
am not convinced because they may be other error but at least they are document that they are no me to to check

27
00:02:52,01 --> 00:02:56,06
and then I went to the city Beijing. Among the four.

28
00:02:58,21 --> 00:03:06,91
Centenarian to go where they're in black and I have still in my office. The plate that they gave me.

29
00:03:08,36 --> 00:03:12,43
Telling that on the twenty two of January two thousand I was there

30
00:03:12,44 --> 00:03:16,75
and it sank me that's the really the starting point so.

31
00:03:18,13 --> 00:03:26,67
The second step was that we have to go from village to village and to look people who read one hundred

32
00:03:26,68 --> 00:03:32,66
and to check their document and that's what we did one by one and.

33
00:03:33,79 --> 00:03:44,08
After two months I was able to conclude that I did not find any error. Only one small error was in this village.

34
00:03:45,38 --> 00:03:50,14
A girl I see a girl who was supposed to die at one hundred

35
00:03:50,15 --> 00:03:56,94
and ten in fact replace our older sister well this older sister diet at age two

36
00:03:57,29 --> 00:04:00,77
and so there was a mistake because they considered that.

37
00:04:00,98 --> 00:04:08,04
It was our sister and it was the second one so she was effectively one zero seven only one zero seven you see

38
00:04:08,51 --> 00:04:15,48
but except this I did not find any error and were surprised about it and I was fully surprise

39
00:04:15,62 --> 00:04:20,00
and that was the starting point of the second step because.

40
00:04:21,49 --> 00:04:27,75
According to those who asked me to come on was perfect you have done your job all is OK

41
00:04:28,4 --> 00:04:36,66
but then I say to my friend Johnny This is not the only thing there is something more strong more I will say more

42
00:04:36,67 --> 00:04:38,84
exceptional Look I say

43
00:04:39,18 --> 00:04:48,3
when you go from one village to the other every time you find new centenarian So they are not everywhere lost in the in

44
00:04:48,31 --> 00:04:57,85
the country they are really group in the mountain area there is a nonrandom distribution of centenarians and I tried.

45
00:04:58,86 --> 00:05:07,21
To do it to put on the map the village where we found centenarians and it was I did it slowly

46
00:05:07,22 --> 00:05:14,2
and I put it in blue pen and I discussed with my friend I say you look this blue zone.

47
00:05:15,6 --> 00:05:23,67
Already in March two thousand I was using the term blue zone to then to fight this area where they ever higher number

48
00:05:23,68 --> 00:05:26,21
of centenarians when I mean what do you mean with.

49
00:05:27,52 --> 00:05:35,09
Justice just because I use a blue pencil and with a blue pencil I marked on the map all the village and I.

50
00:05:36,21 --> 00:05:40,42
Surrounded the place where they have this longevity and I

51
00:05:40,6 --> 00:05:47,7
when I was discussing with my friend I say in the blue zone this outside of the blue zone this so the name Blue Zone

52
00:05:47,71 --> 00:05:51,58
became family between us already in two thousand and

53
00:05:52,4 --> 00:06:00,28
but the big difference is that in most of the study they are doing study on centenarian that are there they're there

54
00:06:00,38 --> 00:06:00,66
they're.

55
00:06:00,87 --> 00:06:08,85
Bit everywhere in the city here we are working with what I name population longevity which means the world population

56
00:06:08,86 --> 00:06:12,57
is the even longer not only one or two person

57
00:06:12,58 --> 00:06:18,24
and the other one are normal no in the village you may have easy two to three four centenarian

58
00:06:18,4 --> 00:06:21,71
and even the Nigerian The number is incredible so.

59
00:06:23,01 --> 00:06:28,7
I push the group to go to this new concept of population longevity

60
00:06:29,19 --> 00:06:34,36
and then somebody in a meeting in October two thousand Tell me in the Roman

61
00:06:35,31 --> 00:06:42,05
but I was it possible that these people reached in so large number one hundred or ninety

62
00:06:42,21 --> 00:06:57,51
and that the men do it also very well on one side. But why you need this. But first the key point was that.

63
00:06:58,91 --> 00:07:02,87
When I tried to explain it in the meeting that we have in Rome or with the same group.

64
00:07:04,51 --> 00:07:11,02
They were really skeptical still skeptical and so I discuss with them

65
00:07:11,58 --> 00:07:19,19
and I understand that the only way to prove that it is very unique is to take one village

66
00:07:19,86 --> 00:07:25,78
and in one village to start to do the full in-depth story to work really

67
00:07:26,2 --> 00:07:35,54
and then I say to my friend we will shoot the village that is the highest in the indicator the longevity indicator I

68
00:07:35,55 --> 00:07:41,78
would say the one that is the sharing of the cake you see you have the cake is the longevity area

69
00:07:41,93 --> 00:07:43,99
but you have one village on the top.

70
00:07:45,27 --> 00:07:51,52
And that was the village where we had this girl one one of the ten ten that was effectively one zero seven

71
00:07:51,53 --> 00:07:59,27
but I know that we are gone they may be a good place so we started in two thousand to collect all generals you get

72
00:07:59,28 --> 00:08:08,78
and demographical data. Grandy but it took a lot of time. For a lot of reasons.

73
00:08:10,74 --> 00:08:18,63
A reason first is that the work is not an easy task finally our database now seventeen thousand person with all the

74
00:08:18,64 --> 00:08:19,4
family links

75
00:08:19,41 --> 00:08:26,5
and a lot of things like that so it's you cannot do this in in one month's it takes you have to look all the birth

76
00:08:26,51 --> 00:08:29,63
record of that record the on a graph of the population register

77
00:08:29,79 --> 00:08:33,28
and so on so it's a very huge work so it took a long time

78
00:08:33,57 --> 00:08:41,73
but in Sardinia there is not only the problem of data collection there is the problem of local sensibility

79
00:08:42,3 --> 00:08:51,7
and after some times I understand that they what they were a bit disturbed by my work they considered that the local

80
00:08:51,71 --> 00:08:59,53
researcher and moreover it was a local policymaker he was deputy in the region and.

81
00:09:01,15 --> 00:09:08,2
I don't want any more that this foreigner because this is important if you are not from the I on you are automatically

82
00:09:08,21 --> 00:09:12,89
for in that this for a no will continue to work with us he is disturbing me

83
00:09:13,42 --> 00:09:22,09
and so at one moment my work was really the basis for a project in the U.S.

84
00:09:22,13 --> 00:09:31,61
and I ate National News Digital Beijing we were directly rank it very high there was even a mention in in this science

85
00:09:31,62 --> 00:09:36,25
that the magazine that this is the crack historical demographic that.

86
00:09:37,43 --> 00:09:44,95
Validated this data so that was done in two thousand and then they decided because of this guy you have to grow.

87
00:09:46,85 --> 00:09:51,39
I have a letter from my professor from the U.K. In the U.S.

88
00:09:51,6 --> 00:09:58,79
Telling Michelle for the future of the research you have to go out from the system it's it's it's crazy for you

89
00:09:59,01 --> 00:10:00,77
when you have such an abstract.

90
00:10:01,04 --> 00:10:05,54
Just because you have a good idea and you feel you have to go ahead with this idea you know

91
00:10:05,55 --> 00:10:10,34
but we are convinced that you are the one that is doing the work so I understand it

92
00:10:10,35 --> 00:10:18,11
but that's not important for us I mean you are for us that one finds in our research in the blues so I would like to

93
00:10:18,12 --> 00:10:21,05
continue on that and executive exactly tell me.

94
00:10:22,97 --> 00:10:31,86
Looking at this this blue zone where we are here what in your opinion makes you so unique Why is this the blues

95
00:10:31,87 --> 00:10:38,48
or what is it in these people that is so magical that they grow so. I think that.

96
00:10:39,77 --> 00:10:45,58
I did not discover it at the beginning at the beginning my only attractive.

97
00:10:46,69 --> 00:10:52,29
To me is that the number of centenarian was very high and that the number of male

98
00:10:52,3 --> 00:10:56,14
and female was at the same level this is unique.

99
00:10:57,37 --> 00:11:03,19
You will never find another place on hurt where the number of centenarian is equal between male

100
00:11:03,2 --> 00:11:10,4
and female it was the situation in the past or it may be still the situation is simply so if she rang our India

101
00:11:10,69 --> 00:11:17,51
but this is because of all the situation this is a question of local cultural situation

102
00:11:17,73 --> 00:11:24,64
but in our modern society us more and more female centenarian compared to male

103
00:11:25,01 --> 00:11:30,66
and so having a place where it's one to one while this is very few so.

104
00:11:31,98 --> 00:11:33,93
Doing so I want

105
00:11:33,94 --> 00:11:43,47
and moreover the indicator of the level of longevity for male was really twice more than in all of the country you have

106
00:11:43,68 --> 00:11:48,45
a change out of ten to reach ninety and in good shape that's OK so.

107
00:11:49,64 --> 00:11:55,25
We did it to sink we did first the data collection but we started also to meet people

108
00:11:55,76 --> 00:12:00,77
and to try to understand why because. When you discover something.

109
00:12:00,86 --> 00:12:06,29
You have to say what but there isn't a turret thing that we have to do is to convince our college

110
00:12:06,96 --> 00:12:08,96
and it took me ten years.

111
00:12:10,58 --> 00:12:18,6
To convince first that the data were true and that the situation is that there is this buttons between

112
00:12:18,61 --> 00:12:28,31
and main if you need any they did even something that I never have in my scientific career they sent without informing

113
00:12:28,32 --> 00:12:28,56
me.

114
00:12:29,6 --> 00:12:34,69
Comment validate a new validation story another team to validate what I did

115
00:12:35,23 --> 00:12:41,52
and that finally I get I got the information after and they found that it was correct

116
00:12:41,69 --> 00:12:51,19
but it's so crazy to have such a situation that they need to really take ten years to agree with the situation part of

117
00:12:51,2 --> 00:12:57,17
that that's clear So tell me about the second part of that what what next it's that this is the only place in the world

118
00:12:57,77 --> 00:13:00,7
where there are male and female sentinels though when

119
00:13:00,9 --> 00:13:11,15
when everybody agree on this then you have to start the explanation and. That therefore we started to do survey.

120
00:13:12,37 --> 00:13:14,89
Not I would say it's not a survey with.

121
00:13:16,2 --> 00:13:17,46
Very long questionnaire

122
00:13:17,47 --> 00:13:24,64
and you know it's a survey that has a large part is open to question to try to understand this is one part of the story

123
00:13:24,65 --> 00:13:33,26
then we also this site with the municipality to do a longevity celebration which means that to be very close with the

124
00:13:33,27 --> 00:13:35,86
population this is the only way to try to understand

125
00:13:36,27 --> 00:13:45,08
and progressively we point out the different aspects of their life that could could that might contribute.

126
00:13:46,66 --> 00:13:51,28
Exceptional longevity the first one that emerge.

127
00:13:52,64 --> 00:14:00,22
The fact that these people as a physical activity that really don't stop at sixty five they continue to work.

128
00:14:00,8 --> 00:14:09,15
Even at ninety they decide to keep their garden and so on so there is physical activity that this really.

129
00:14:10,53 --> 00:14:19,87
High level Moreover in the village of us seen if you go from one place to the other one you have always to jump the

130
00:14:19,88 --> 00:14:29,59
slope every way which means that we are not in the flat area we are obliged to do effort on a daily basis.

131
00:14:30,66 --> 00:14:35,36
In term of physical activity and physical effort that's clear there is.

132
00:14:37,08 --> 00:14:43,96
A lesson that we have to consider from me it's not only a year it's always also in other places like this one around

133
00:14:43,97 --> 00:14:52,54
the world so they live longer as active That's the point then. The second point is the fact that.

134
00:14:55,54 --> 00:15:04,33
What they eat is quite different I will not say that that they do they have a method in the diet they don't have this

135
00:15:04,34 --> 00:15:09,55
military and diet because for example somebody will say that take fish

136
00:15:10,24 --> 00:15:14,16
but if you look the fish you have twenty eight kilometer from the sea

137
00:15:14,38 --> 00:15:20,78
and in the past the fish never arrived here so it's not the fish it's meat they have meat

138
00:15:21,17 --> 00:15:23,82
and they eat quite a lot of meat.

139
00:15:25,64 --> 00:15:28,38
Their fruit and they have ventured the bill

140
00:15:28,67 --> 00:15:36,58
but what is too important thing is that this is a locally produced food in the village they do pursuit also this

141
00:15:36,59 --> 00:15:45,17
happens they do the collusion as this is a special dumpling they do the Sheesh they have the potato they have their

142
00:15:45,18 --> 00:15:55,34
wine so I will say that compared to our western society ninety per cent of what they appear on the table is locally

143
00:15:55,35 --> 00:16:00,74
produced and does not go throughout the food industry and for me.

144
00:16:01,26 --> 00:16:08,96
I would say that in our country it's the oppose it you have ninety per cent that went out the food industry so the

145
00:16:08,97 --> 00:16:13,28
natural food is very important but moreover.

146
00:16:14,31 --> 00:16:17,26
I would say that the wine is not the best best best

147
00:16:17,6 --> 00:16:23,14
and even they serve it cold if you have cold wind it for us it's a crime

148
00:16:23,44 --> 00:16:31,65
but it's local it's not it doesn't go to our system where they add something they suppress you know that some wine now

149
00:16:31,66 --> 00:16:33,95
you have a taste but the taste as been added

150
00:16:34,81 --> 00:16:43,03
and so here you are sure that this is wind that they produce the tomato everything or leaf the same and so and so.

151
00:16:44,08 --> 00:16:47,27
But as I say the meat become.

152
00:16:48,42 --> 00:16:51,9
Quite abundant the pork at that for example

153
00:16:52,18 --> 00:16:59,64
and this is the talk seems to be similar with other place to pork the goat not so much a cow so and

154
00:17:00,09 --> 00:17:07,44
but what this clear is that these animals the meat of these animals is not the same as the one in our country because

155
00:17:07,79 --> 00:17:11,05
these are the man has been in the mounting they at.

156
00:17:13,04 --> 00:17:20,77
I would say a lot of herbs that are until York City and and that and so the meat is fully different

157
00:17:21,27 --> 00:17:26,57
and that's something that you may compare yesterday I was in another place

158
00:17:27,27 --> 00:17:34,82
and the meat was really want to feel fully fully different compared to what we have in our country where we go to

159
00:17:35,26 --> 00:17:42,32
process that is not exactly so the quality of the food the locally produced food and then

160
00:17:42,78 --> 00:17:53,06
when they do a meal it's not fast food it takes time OK they meet in the family so that social dimension of the meal is

161
00:17:53,07 --> 00:18:00,77
also very important you may have two or three hours around a table a large family and.

162
00:18:01,08 --> 00:18:05,56
And they eat they eat baby too much I don't know

163
00:18:05,6 --> 00:18:12,62
but it's that the social dimension of the meal is very important sort of social infrastructure of the areas very

164
00:18:12,63 --> 00:18:19,57
important exactly the social support for the oldest old which means for example it's the only place.

165
00:18:20,61 --> 00:18:27,41
In the world that I have seen that they produce calendar with all the centenarian every year so you have a lot of thing

166
00:18:27,42 --> 00:18:27,94
that happen

167
00:18:28,08 --> 00:18:33,76
when we organize is the logic of it is a liberation that there were thirty one for the gravity of centenarian in the

168
00:18:33,77 --> 00:18:37,79
street so they are really promoting

169
00:18:37,92 --> 00:18:46,26
and centenarian promoting the longevity so that these very old people are not outside of the system you see they are

170
00:18:46,27 --> 00:18:56,14
not push outside of the daily life they are proud of the daily life in this village the support to old people nobody go

171
00:18:56,81 --> 00:19:04,48
there is no nursing if you have to go to nursing home you should go to to the city that is half an hour from you so

172
00:19:04,82 --> 00:19:12,76
they stay in the village if they are not living with their child they stay in the neighboring house so they stay in

173
00:19:12,77 --> 00:19:21,69
their own. Surrounding environment but they have direct support and if they have no children.

174
00:19:23,15 --> 00:19:29,13
They are the neighbor people neighboring paper will take care of them down there is a solidarity there is a very

175
00:19:29,14 --> 00:19:36,05
important so the place of the hold of all in the society is very very important

176
00:19:36,35 --> 00:19:44,88
and I would say that our post modern society tried to put away after some age you are even put away at fifty from the

177
00:19:44,89 --> 00:19:50,01
work you are away when you are becoming dependent they put you in a lurching all

178
00:19:50,02 --> 00:19:58,26
and so you know you are really integrated when you were in the border of the blues or you have within the blues

179
00:19:58,27 --> 00:19:59,99
and then just outside.

180
00:20:01,93 --> 00:20:08,6
There is already a difference what is the difference what makes the just outside then and then I will say that.

181
00:20:09,78 --> 00:20:15,96
This is the problem of the shaping of the blue zone which means that in fact you have a gradient

182
00:20:16,91 --> 00:20:23,76
and grandees on the top the neighboring villages are not allowed now delay are not far from the top

183
00:20:24,00 --> 00:20:26,9
and so you try to see what are the same.

184
00:20:27,92 --> 00:20:37,1
Characteristic of these village but if you go to the valley there Dr Ali is there below then maybe the solidarity is.

185
00:20:38,33 --> 00:20:41,78
The same but you feel a big difference you feel a big difference.

186
00:20:43,22 --> 00:20:47,63
There are more people people are more the result of immigration

187
00:20:47,64 --> 00:20:53,33
and why in this village people went out yes there are some immigration

188
00:20:53,58 --> 00:21:00,73
but there are very limited people that arrive here which means that the problem is that the population is decreasing

189
00:21:01,15 --> 00:21:04,59
because when you are young people you want to find a job.

190
00:21:05,67 --> 00:21:12,28
This is not easy so one out of to leave the village at age twenty or thirty and the other one will stay

191
00:21:12,56 --> 00:21:17,02
but then the population is decreasing so this village are really.

192
00:21:18,38 --> 00:21:26,73
Keeping their cultural their specificity and that's why the solidarity is still the highest in the city like calorie

193
00:21:26,74 --> 00:21:33,13
and and society this is not possible to see this there and that's very important point

194
00:21:33,4 --> 00:21:38,75
but where does it stop this is the problem so we did it on the map.

195
00:21:40,16 --> 00:21:46,83
A place that we named the blue zone with fourteen village by based on the longevity index

196
00:21:47,19 --> 00:21:53,14
and then we have a larger one that cover all the Montane of Sardinia that is a light blue zone if you want

197
00:21:53,42 --> 00:22:00,77
and then you have the rest of Sardinia and we did it based on a scientific investigation which mooting methods and.

198
00:22:01,27 --> 00:22:06,88
But so we look for that the longevity index and now and now we go with this

199
00:22:06,97 --> 00:22:12,07
and we try to see what is the difference between a longevity village and another one

200
00:22:12,43 --> 00:22:16,62
and that's what we are doing now we are picking some villages that are not in the blues

201
00:22:17,43 --> 00:22:23,46
and we try to compare what are the different between the two motors What are the differences how we are not yet far in

202
00:22:23,47 --> 00:22:31,07
this because this is something not easy to do because we have different for example the level of dementia should be

203
00:22:31,08 --> 00:22:36,23
compare the level of depression but also old genes genes

204
00:22:36,36 --> 00:22:44,92
and the some biomedical indicator biomarker recently we discovered that there in the scene there is a big difference

205
00:22:44,93 --> 00:22:47,23
between what what we found

206
00:22:47,86 --> 00:22:55,97
and what we found in the city what differences are fine there is something that make I will say this is the job of my

207
00:22:56,01 --> 00:23:03,38
colleagues never was what was what was what was that what it means that they are taking advantage of what they eat

208
00:23:03,39 --> 00:23:08,08
and so on better than the one in the valley and it should contribute

209
00:23:08,09 --> 00:23:15,77
but it's not easy to associate the two for example somebody try to explain that height you know people are very short

210
00:23:15,78 --> 00:23:21,49
here they are an average one meter sixty four man and and they're you know even shorter

211
00:23:21,99 --> 00:23:25,09
and somebody did find a gene explaining this

212
00:23:25,33 --> 00:23:32,62
and now we are doing some review to see is it this genes is it something like that and so is the food and so on

213
00:23:32,79 --> 00:23:35,04
but we so really big difference

214
00:23:35,08 --> 00:23:42,27
and in the in the country the people in the mountain are shorter than people in the in the city where that that's very

215
00:23:42,28 --> 00:23:49,95
important Can you imagine the average age at military service about one meter sixty and it's not so long time ago

216
00:23:50,29 --> 00:23:57,31
and if you look in the village now you will see everybody is a bit short of that so that's that's one difference this

217
00:23:57,32 --> 00:24:00,77
is a strong difference yes so you have probably.

218
00:24:00,8 --> 00:24:08,45
Also some difference in the in the genes you have probably you have for sure difference in the lifestyle that's clear

219
00:24:08,7 --> 00:24:13,92
in the city you cannot have the same life died idea of the quality of water air

220
00:24:13,96 --> 00:24:21,77
and everything the absence of stress all those thing are really different the main problem for scientists is to put

221
00:24:21,78 --> 00:24:27,43
everything in the same model and based on this just to conclude.

222
00:24:28,6 --> 00:24:37,00
You are dealing with an interdisciplinary approach which means that you have an information from environment from

223
00:24:37,01 --> 00:24:42,37
nutrition from other approaches from social issues from demographic from genetics

224
00:24:42,41 --> 00:24:51,79
and even now from a pigeon It takes a pigeon it takes is a new way to enter in the study of longevity it's the

225
00:24:51,8 --> 00:24:54,53
interaction between genetics and environment

226
00:24:55,04 --> 00:25:03,68
and we are convince We tried to do something in Sardinia we generated we did not find any genes that may explain their

227
00:25:03,69 --> 00:25:10,88
longevity in Sardinia but why because we need three thousand ten thousand centenarians to.

228
00:25:12,06 --> 00:25:16,05
Do research we conclusion in genetics in a P.G.

229
00:25:16,06 --> 00:25:21,69
Tips and that's very attractive with two hundred person you may already conclude something

230
00:25:22,29 --> 00:25:32,57
and what is good is that usually they are now doing centenarian that centenarian plaque block like this here we will do

231
00:25:32,58 --> 00:25:32,76
it.

232
00:25:33,89 --> 00:25:43,68
On a population that this common trait which means the same food same environment so we are controlling a lot of very

233
00:25:43,69 --> 00:25:48,13
able so that we will be able to see if something is really particularly

234
00:25:48,37 --> 00:25:51,8
and we have already some explanation because the food is the same

235
00:25:52,14 --> 00:26:00,77
and so so we are in the best condition to see if there is an A.P. Genetics of longevity and it is.

236
00:26:00,98 --> 00:26:03,49
We already some explanation if it emerge

237
00:26:03,67 --> 00:26:12,27
and wondering what what this explanation could be it should be linked to the special life of Shepherd So you have to

238
00:26:12,28 --> 00:26:14,64
now that in the area.

239
00:26:15,7 --> 00:26:21,52
Beginning of the twentieth century everybody was shepherds or as parents that were Shepherd

240
00:26:21,53 --> 00:26:28,53
and so what was the life of a shepherd they have to go in winter in the valley six months

241
00:26:28,74 --> 00:26:35,32
and they go really forty kilometer from here with all their animals only the men go down the shepherd

242
00:26:35,84 --> 00:26:41,84
and they come back in May early May in the village with all the animals

243
00:26:42,02 --> 00:26:45,2
and this is one week of big celebration in the village

244
00:26:45,55 --> 00:26:52,52
but they stay only one week in the village that's why Nine months later you have a lot of baby justice

245
00:26:52,76 --> 00:27:00,48
and then they go up to the mountain and they stay in the month in the world summer and come back in October November

246
00:27:00,74 --> 00:27:10,58
and then again go to the winter so these shepherds spent most of their life outside of their family they have a very

247
00:27:10,59 --> 00:27:18,38
different way of living they add very different food because they have to do to rely on their.

248
00:27:20,01 --> 00:27:25,52
Own that they found and on this Brett that you can see this bread that you take with you

249
00:27:25,73 --> 00:27:32,96
and may stay several months this be stuck with it this is bread that you have to wash before to eat to make it easier

250
00:27:32,97 --> 00:27:43,85
to eat and so it's different nutrition different way of living and so I assume and the mother at all as all the.

251
00:27:44,9 --> 00:27:49,6
I would say all the difficulty all the stress of the family this is the reason why men

252
00:27:49,61 --> 00:27:57,36
and women live probably the same the same because their life is fully different but at the same time.

253
00:27:59,45 --> 00:28:00,77
Having these very.

254
00:28:01,73 --> 00:28:08,08
Positive aspect in the month in fresh air fresh water good food no stress

255
00:28:08,09 --> 00:28:12,33
and so on may have an impact on your children and grandchildren

256
00:28:12,37 --> 00:28:20,1
and it comes to be genetics because there is a transmission from generation to generation of some trade coming from you

257
00:28:20,11 --> 00:28:28,1
may have this good genes but due to the vitamin it is not activated and that's very important or you may have a.

258
00:28:29,24 --> 00:28:30,02
Bad genes

259
00:28:30,03 --> 00:28:38,29
but also do due to the fact that it's not activated you will not be disturbed by this so rule of the environment is

260
00:28:38,3 --> 00:28:39,08
very important

261
00:28:39,29 --> 00:28:48,55
and this is a very good message for society because for me it would be crazy if I conclude with my study that there are

262
00:28:48,56 --> 00:28:54,34
two kinds of people those who have this good genes and those who don't know that if there is a logic.

263
00:28:55,39 --> 00:29:01,18
And somebody has the longevity genes don't problem you may do what you want you will live longer than the other one can

264
00:29:01,19 --> 00:29:04,97
you imagine it is this is that at Mystic there is no solution

265
00:29:05,16 --> 00:29:13,48
but know the good point with a passion it exists that you may activate on activate those you may do something yourself

266
00:29:13,61 --> 00:29:19,26
and you may even take advantage of what your previous your parents and grandparents that

267
00:29:19,68 --> 00:29:24,86
and maybe the secret is that a lot of these ancestor were shepherds

268
00:29:24,87 --> 00:29:30,74
and has a wonderful life with wonderful situation with physical activity food and so on

269
00:29:31,17 --> 00:29:37,91
and it may explain the difference between male and female and it may explain why the longevity is the highest

270
00:29:38,36 --> 00:29:43,41
but that's it it really we are only at the starting point

271
00:29:43,72 --> 00:29:51,19
and that's why it will probably go on several several years and when you look at when I would live here for example

272
00:29:51,2 --> 00:29:52,81
when I would move into this village

273
00:29:53,54 --> 00:30:01,05
and there I would start to know where I was discussing with colleagues it was in the meeting in Bosh. Don't.

274
00:30:02,46 --> 00:30:07,4
They say this mission is a bit crazy because it seems to recommend to go

275
00:30:07,41 --> 00:30:15,3
and live as Shepparton the bone pain know if you come here and live as shepherd. You don't have.

276
00:30:16,61 --> 00:30:24,11
To work and it will take time to be integrated and to follow all the rules and so so I will not recover

277
00:30:24,12 --> 00:30:27,25
and that every bit bigger will become arrive

278
00:30:27,7 --> 00:30:32,48
and be shepherded will not change their life expectancy OK I mean provably the situation

279
00:30:32,77 --> 00:30:40,29
but this is not the solution what we try to do when we try to do it now in the US to try to see what.

280
00:30:41,37 --> 00:30:45,88
The lesson that you may take from this life here

281
00:30:46,44 --> 00:30:54,1
and to try to transfer it in the other possible then society to see what this feasible what can we keep as lesson

282
00:30:54,53 --> 00:31:01,73
and it's clear that the social links very important the food is very important the genes you cannot change anything

283
00:31:01,74 --> 00:31:09,86
and this is not you not to concede physical activity is it's important not to stop to work suddenly at sixty five

284
00:31:09,87 --> 00:31:18,46
and to say now I will stop working I was single only on my my wellbeing this is the only way to go directly to the

285
00:31:18,47 --> 00:31:25,7
cemetery OK you have to keep active to keep your brain active but also physical activity and so on

286
00:31:26,03 --> 00:31:32,34
and that's what we are try to do now in some places in the US in the so-called blue room project.

287
00:31:33,42 --> 00:31:36,49
People in the valley in the city decide to meet

288
00:31:37,12 --> 00:31:44,88
and to discuss between them so what can we do as a community to improve those things so the way to act is not to say

289
00:31:45,07 --> 00:31:46,96
you have to eat this you F.

290
00:31:46,97 --> 00:31:52,48
To do the tricycle activity and so we don't have direct interaction between our result

291
00:31:52,49 --> 00:32:00,77
and in the video people we make the an environment so that they will spontaneously adopt or.

292
00:32:00,87 --> 00:32:07,69
New and more appropriate lifestyle just to take an example in the restaurant we promote longevity food

293
00:32:08,04 --> 00:32:14,99
or in some restaurant we give smaller plates because then you will eat you eat a bit less

294
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:22,08
and this is very good evidence that that will tell you that big caloric restriction is very good you have to eat until

295
00:32:22,09 --> 00:32:25,66
your stomach is eighty person full but not one hundred so

296
00:32:26,23 --> 00:32:31,44
and then you put in the shop for example you promote you don't promote the ships and the Coca-Cola

297
00:32:31,45 --> 00:32:33,71
and so you put in the front.

298
00:32:34,73 --> 00:32:43,41
Apple fruit and so on you are preparing a place to do psych that would do to bike to food you are

299
00:32:43,42 --> 00:32:44,86
and grazing social links

300
00:32:44,87 --> 00:32:54,78
and so these are all think that are in direct way to promote healthy aging so all what we are doing in here is to to

301
00:32:54,79 --> 00:32:57,13
find what are the recipe for Healthy Aging

302
00:32:57,36 --> 00:33:04,22
and to try to see which one can be transposed in other without coming in large number

303
00:33:04,23 --> 00:33:09,61
and disturbing the world system because it's a nonsense you cannot hear you know better understand it

304
00:33:09,62 --> 00:33:15,88
and some import also in this society I mean if there is some immigration I can believe that this whole village is like

305
00:33:15,89 --> 00:33:25,48
a. Marker like a fortress does that what does that do to to the community and to the to longevity so.

306
00:33:26,62 --> 00:33:32,14
In fact all our centenarian are born because they were born one hundred years ago

307
00:33:32,68 --> 00:33:39,99
and the Immigration is only probably started after the fifty when the village was opened to the.

308
00:33:41,37 --> 00:33:46,6
Electricity plant and so on the roads were better so I will say that nowadays.

309
00:33:48,4 --> 00:33:52,46
Half of the marriage are married people from outside

310
00:33:52,81 --> 00:34:00,77
but up to fifty it was ninety per cent of the marriage that were between two people from the same village we.

311
00:34:00,8 --> 00:34:04,43
I mean that immigration the ear is really low

312
00:34:05,13 --> 00:34:12,78
and it's very recent so we are not yet able to see the consequence of immigration but what I may tell you is that

313
00:34:13,36 --> 00:34:20,28
when I'm talking in the village I try to convince them that they the longevity for them is a treasure.

314
00:34:21,4 --> 00:34:26,02
But that it is really important to keep it from generation to generation

315
00:34:26,49 --> 00:34:33,36
and I am a bit afraid that it might be a temporary phenomenon which means that

316
00:34:33,87 --> 00:34:36,01
and I will explain it to you very simply.

317
00:34:37,04 --> 00:34:46,16
The centenarian today work a lot in the past they have very difficult conditions so they are first elected

318
00:34:46,5 --> 00:34:57,98
and then they have a very heavy life and very active life and suddenly in the sixty's when they started to to be sick

319
00:34:57,99 --> 00:35:01,5
or to have a problem the public health was the globe

320
00:35:01,86 --> 00:35:07,09
and they have suddenly access to a lot of thing against malaria for example in forty eight

321
00:35:07,3 --> 00:35:13,42
and then they haven't lost people and so on so they take advantage of their past life what is very active

322
00:35:13,78 --> 00:35:22,59
and modern life what bring them public health service and so on and so you have a conjunction of to sing

323
00:35:23,26 --> 00:35:29,14
but in future the problem is that you will keep probably the access to public health

324
00:35:29,36 --> 00:35:33,73
but you will lose the difficult life in the morning

325
00:35:33,82 --> 00:35:38,11
and in the past it was your pose it you have only this active life

326
00:35:38,25 --> 00:35:48,23
and no public health so for us there is a very important question mark is it a temporary effort that with the emergence

327
00:35:48,24 --> 00:35:53,74
of a lot of longevity now and not a random longevity as it is in our country elsewhere

328
00:35:54,29 --> 00:36:00,51
or is it something that we may keep alive for the future and that's accepting to discuss with local.

329
00:36:01,26 --> 00:36:03,2
And to convince them that they have a treasure.

330
00:36:04,22 --> 00:36:06,73
But they have to do a lot of effort to keep it

331
00:36:07,09 --> 00:36:14,21
and I am a bit afraid that the young generation has not yet understood that this is a real challenge that's important.

332
00:36:15,42 --> 00:36:32,22
And for you as a demographer Can you explain. What fascinates you. This part of democracy. OK this is another story.

333
00:36:34,45 --> 00:36:41,82
I will say that. Some demographic the only thing that they are interested in is number.

334
00:36:42,85 --> 00:36:49,19
Mortality table and so on they never met anybody they never bet the population with.

335
00:36:50,35 --> 00:36:55,89
The danger act they don't know they just look in the starter sticks and work like this or they do more than once

336
00:36:55,9 --> 00:37:05,76
or for me. I have always been interested to meet people. And to work at the local level my father was.

337
00:37:07,05 --> 00:37:13,91
A mentoring teacher he was the master of one village he was the only teacher in the village at the elementary school it

338
00:37:13,92 --> 00:37:19,71
was a village of three hundred inhabitants I know the village by heart I have been every way in the village I did a

339
00:37:19,72 --> 00:37:21,62
story of the village the big book

340
00:37:21,83 --> 00:37:30,13
and I have the full genealogy of the vision I was in the twenty already interested by the mana graphic aspect which

341
00:37:30,14 --> 00:37:39,23
means everything on a given population so that you may try to understand how it works and when I arrive.

342
00:37:40,29 --> 00:37:43,34
You have the initial request of validation I did it

343
00:37:43,81 --> 00:37:52,58
but then this is what I have in in my interest this one a graphic aspect this this a contact with the population emerge

344
00:37:53,1 --> 00:38:00,77
and I decide to go slowly in this direction to work on one village to try to understand not only demographic.

345
00:38:00,89 --> 00:38:06,05
Also what is outside to meet people and to interact with this population

346
00:38:06,34 --> 00:38:13,61
and now I was the one that introduced the longevity celebration I was the one that put this on the witness book Asprey

347
00:38:13,62 --> 00:38:14,51
mother musky.

348
00:38:15,66 --> 00:38:19,78
Mortality muscular they were very happy so they make me sit in the needle

349
00:38:19,79 --> 00:38:26,35
or in this village so I am I am fully involved in the village I cannot walk in the village with without being in touch

350
00:38:26,36 --> 00:38:35,1
with people so this is very important for me as researcher to be in close contact with the population where you are

351
00:38:35,11 --> 00:38:42,47
working every day and to tell him them we do symposium in the village for people in the village

352
00:38:42,85 --> 00:38:50,46
and we trekked researcher from all over the world from Japan Korea on Kong us and they come to Tokyo

353
00:38:51,29 --> 00:38:53,6
and there was a translation in Italian

354
00:38:53,77 --> 00:38:58,62
and people were there on the first row nine hundred ninety two trying to understand

355
00:38:58,68 --> 00:39:07,15
but very proud that this is their village so you see this is a forty different way of working I am demographic Yes I am

356
00:39:07,16 --> 00:39:12,33
basically demographic I am I am even astrophysicist at the beginning so I became demographic

357
00:39:12,58 --> 00:39:20,45
but my main interest is not to be demographic is to do it to discover this concept of loser because for me it's crazy

358
00:39:20,46 --> 00:39:26,61
and I see it every day how people are interested by this and to try to convince people scientists

359
00:39:26,65 --> 00:39:30,13
but also other people this is a very exceptional situation

360
00:39:30,53 --> 00:39:35,61
and there is really question beyond how is it possible that this iteration exists

361
00:39:35,95 --> 00:39:42,89
and I'm still that I was retired four years ago and it did not change anything I am continuing

362
00:39:42,9 --> 00:39:45,75
and I will continue as soon as long as I may do it

363
00:39:46,07 --> 00:39:53,81
and convince young people to continue also because this is really an attractive story for you the magic word.

364
00:39:55,33 --> 00:40:00,7
The magic work the measure of quirk. Patient.

365
00:40:02,34 --> 00:40:09,63
If you are not question it with what you are doing in terms of research stay in your office try to publish a paper that

366
00:40:09,64 --> 00:40:11,4
will not be read by anybody else

367
00:40:11,41 --> 00:40:19,59
or just a limited number of person that are just happy together with your models though you know what we are doing is

368
00:40:19,6 --> 00:40:23,34
really evil of interest for The Root population and everybody me

369
00:40:23,35 --> 00:40:27,11
and the stand everybody be understand what we asked looking for

370
00:40:27,79 --> 00:40:31,54
and as soon as we will got some answers we will come back to them and

371
00:40:31,71 --> 00:40:37,38
and say look this is something this is something so this is really to be passionated by your research

372
00:40:37,69 --> 00:40:45,81
and that there is no problem and you will go on you are you know are serious you are archetypes and we think of you.

373
00:40:48,25 --> 00:40:50,6
Explore what you think rather.

374
00:40:51,73 --> 00:41:01,59
Since I was very young I remember I was probably six I have already met on the wall in my sleeping room between I think

375
00:41:01,6 --> 00:41:09,74
the first thing that interests me was your graphic variation so I I try all the time to travel

376
00:41:10,56 --> 00:41:19,16
and I better try to travel than to read books I have a neighbor in my flat is reading books I am travelling I have a

377
00:41:19,17 --> 00:41:27,64
brother he is in did not move one day he did not go out from Belgium when I have been everywhere so I want to travel

378
00:41:27,98 --> 00:41:33,26
and not to travel as a tourist I want and this unfortunately of demographic

379
00:41:33,27 --> 00:41:42,65
and on longevity bring me in so wonderful place two weeks ago I was in Caucasus in a valley I have been in China in a

380
00:41:42,66 --> 00:41:49,68
remote place I have been everywhere in place where you are not tourist you enter in the family your try to understand

381
00:41:49,9 --> 00:41:57,51
and why because you discover so wonderful thing and your eye both to try to compare the situation

382
00:41:57,86 --> 00:42:00,77
and if you want to see something you need it.

383
00:42:00,87 --> 00:42:02,05
Compare with other place

384
00:42:02,38 --> 00:42:09,35
and that's what I'm doing to try to compare all those places around the world I visited eighty five different countries

385
00:42:09,92 --> 00:42:10,37
and.

386
00:42:11,57 --> 00:42:18,42
An older European country for example that you're traveling with what makes you an explorer a next priority as that

387
00:42:18,69 --> 00:42:23,34
these travel are never planned by other people than me which means that

388
00:42:23,54 --> 00:42:30,7
when I went to go causes three weeks ago I first start to look in the data I was everything

389
00:42:30,71 --> 00:42:32,41
and then I say we have to go there.

390
00:42:34,14 --> 00:42:43,33
Maybe in your rooms on me yes it was their wish was to see if well plays in Georgia maybe consider as blues

391
00:42:44,02 --> 00:42:52,29
and to do this first I have to look to start the second data to work to look what is written and I have a.

392
00:42:54,69 --> 00:43:00,4
Seventy three already somebody say there isn't caucuses and longevity so I went there already in two thousand

393
00:43:00,41 --> 00:43:09,27
and three and I was really in trouble but then. Tallinn University say we will go to Georgia for.

394
00:43:10,63 --> 00:43:15,48
Forefront of formation I don't know I say OK if you go to Georgia I go with you

395
00:43:15,94 --> 00:43:23,24
but I have a really an objective I want to find the place that could be a blue zone and to go there

396
00:43:23,39 --> 00:43:26,63
and to assess the situation so I started to convince them

397
00:43:27,04 --> 00:43:31,8
and finally we went to the message of Ali this is just the a by the L.

398
00:43:31,81 --> 00:43:36,96
Group the highest mounting it's a very remote area you need three hours to go to the village

399
00:43:37,06 --> 00:43:42,45
and then three more hours to do forty two kilometer to go on the highest village of Europe two thousand and three

400
00:43:42,46 --> 00:43:49,04
and it's a wonderful place I have never seen this place like this and then I will say that.

401
00:43:50,23 --> 00:43:56,07
I organize everything and therefore you need to be in touch with local people because you cannot go

402
00:43:56,08 --> 00:44:00,74
and visit the centenarian like this spontaneous the U.S. To do to.

403
00:44:00,8 --> 00:44:02,29
To be in touch with local people

404
00:44:02,47 --> 00:44:10,24
and finally what we did we have a guide that bring us during one day to visit six centenarian and.

405
00:44:12,34 --> 00:44:22,8
It was crazy I will say because you have the possibility to enter a normal house one go to was told me I want to die so

406
00:44:22,81 --> 00:44:30,56
you have really crazy situation in another one it was the Monday after Easter we were invited to the family meal to go

407
00:44:30,57 --> 00:44:38,31
to the cemetery to eat on the on the grave there with them because this is the way they do it in a wonderful landscape

408
00:44:38,32 --> 00:44:46,22
it was tertiary we've also invited to drink wine to drink the local and we visited six centenarian

409
00:44:46,71 --> 00:44:53,26
and I remember this girl eighty seven no one no one no one running around me there and shaking

410
00:44:53,55 --> 00:44:57,97
and then we did the survey the day after we went to archives local archives

411
00:44:58,17 --> 00:45:05,79
and she was only eighty seven according to US So none of the six centenarian that we met was real centenarian How come.

412
00:45:06,95 --> 00:45:16,1
There were their ID cards say that they were said that ARE YOU OK but if you look in the household book from thirty

413
00:45:16,11 --> 00:45:20,34
and forty then you see that the date of birth is not the same.

414
00:45:21,98 --> 00:45:24,33
This possible I have not yet the full explanation

415
00:45:24,61 --> 00:45:30,42
but it could be possible that to get quickly access to their pension they push a bit

416
00:45:30,98 --> 00:45:36,2
but in some time they push fourteen years you see it's a bit crazy

417
00:45:36,21 --> 00:45:42,36
but as demographics we are able to see it quickly because you cannot ever a baby at fifty two you cannot marry for the

418
00:45:42,37 --> 00:45:48,14
first time at thirty eight there is some aspect that you directly

419
00:45:48,48 --> 00:45:54,56
and the stand so the survey just a survey asking did the Euro birth of children and brother

420
00:45:54,57 --> 00:46:00,74
and sister bring us in trouble but the day after we went to the local archive the people were very impressed.

421
00:46:00,89 --> 00:46:06,71
We found all the data and the conclusion was clear none of these centenarian was readers

422
00:46:06,72 --> 00:46:15,95
and I so now I have to do a scientific paper because if you have a negative point you have also to tell it it's not

423
00:46:15,96 --> 00:46:24,01
only see it in Sardinia it could be that I will conclude by a negative point oh probably it was positive

424
00:46:24,07 --> 00:46:29,12
but the Coke has this I am sure there is no exceptional longevity why.

425
00:46:30,45 --> 00:46:37,19
Two weeks before Corey and where there are two to do film and a lot of people go there they are very happy

426
00:46:37,2 --> 00:46:45,27
but I have to conclude that it's not the exception where comes this wish of countries

427
00:46:45,28 --> 00:46:49,88
or people who have made it now that having being.

428
00:46:53,39 --> 00:46:57,68
So you have to understand that when it is the case yes

429
00:46:58,09 --> 00:47:06,17
when a village is put into evidence for their longevity Everybody's proud of longevity Stalin was the one that promoted

430
00:47:06,18 --> 00:47:14,44
the longevity in Georgia he was very proud of the longevity of the Georgian man and so if I have a village

431
00:47:14,87 --> 00:47:21,23
and they want to be the first in longevity it's the situation here in Sardinia they compete between village to be

432
00:47:21,24 --> 00:47:27,08
number one in longevity and if I come in read a grand day and say I will go to the next village

433
00:47:27,09 --> 00:47:33,02
or are a bit afraid that I will found that the other villages better data than they have in store so it's really

434
00:47:33,03 --> 00:47:33,82
competition

435
00:47:34,11 --> 00:47:41,12
and I have even some problem because of this competition it's not just more competition it's a competition in turmoil

436
00:47:41,13 --> 00:47:48,83
at policy level political level and so on and for a lot of think so they are proud of layered longevity

437
00:47:49,28 --> 00:47:54,93
and everywhere and a country will be proud like Japanese to be number one for the life expectancy

438
00:47:54,94 --> 00:48:00,34
and everywhere there's a Japanese wonderful Okinawa number one.

439
00:48:00,84 --> 00:48:06,79
So you have to be number one and longevity seems to be the result of the best L.T.

440
00:48:06,8 --> 00:48:13,79
Aging of the well being of the population longevity is something that is the best sign of this of well being and

441
00:48:13,8 --> 00:48:19,57
when you say competition between villages here what I mean by that this is another story.

442
00:48:20,99 --> 00:48:30,36
To joining ten year I promoted Grandy and I put it on the reader's book as the place where men are living longer so

443
00:48:30,83 --> 00:48:40,25
and then I have some information that other village Arabic Jairus OK And I say myself that OK even a ground days on the

444
00:48:40,26 --> 00:48:46,22
top the surrounding village are also not far so I expressed the wish to

445
00:48:46,79 --> 00:48:56,35
and large the area of investigation showed there was one girl from that village there that was also interested to

446
00:48:56,36 --> 00:49:02,26
attract people because she has a note I'll tell you there were some interest but she scientists she did a B a Ph D.

447
00:49:02,27 --> 00:49:05,02
Does a bone so they start.

448
00:49:06,66 --> 00:49:14,66
To bend it sure that different municipality will be interested but doing so they wanted to do and that's a C.H.

449
00:49:14,67 --> 00:49:23,44
and Of Blues old village OK And I understand that they were at the end of the day they were Tree Association starting

450
00:49:23,45 --> 00:49:29,81
their one with this girl one with with a professor in Calgary and one with vinegar

451
00:49:29,82 --> 00:49:32,24
and they did do that also while Association

452
00:49:32,63 --> 00:49:41,7
and then we had grand they say Michelle you are with us you have not to be with the other one so I was not able to be

453
00:49:41,71 --> 00:49:42,92
with one with the other one

454
00:49:42,93 --> 00:49:51,09
and we did third one then I my position now is very clear I am a scientist I want to be outside of this competition

455
00:49:51,4 --> 00:49:55,00
and I want to stay at the scientific level too I will have today

456
00:49:55,01 --> 00:50:00,69
or tomorrow some discussion with the sin that go with people to say I don't want to say that.

457
00:50:00,8 --> 00:50:09,28
I am explosively with your village what is important for me is if one village is interested I may ask them to collect

458
00:50:09,29 --> 00:50:14,02
the data what they do know five really just collected the data and I went there to validate

459
00:50:14,19 --> 00:50:17,86
and they are also not so high but they are high in longevity

460
00:50:18,28 --> 00:50:22,24
but just to give an example the village we will go tomorrow say Will.

461
00:50:23,35 --> 00:50:30,42
Organize this celebration to give the diploma of longevity village and we give it to six village

462
00:50:30,59 --> 00:50:38,15
and we are Gandhi was included but then during the dinner the saying that go ask me tell me I am engineer

463
00:50:38,68 --> 00:50:47,6
and if you have indicator I know that you have the value of these indicated you may tell me what is the ranking to see

464
00:50:47,61 --> 00:50:56,32
if I am really better than we are Grundy so I spend two hours to convience him that the topic is not the ranking the

465
