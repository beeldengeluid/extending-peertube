1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,650
Micheal Poulain:  [inaudible 00:00:01] try to see the story. So, [inaudible 00:00:09] summarize the situation.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,850
So, this village there is included in the blue zone, as well as the neighboring village,

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:28,240
so now we have about 14 village here that are forming a block that we will name the "blue zone." This is very important.

4
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,210
And then around you have also some mountain, but the longevity is a bit lower.

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,490
So this is what I will name the "light blue zone." And the rest of the country is not a long-living population.

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,960
They are not involved in the longevity. So this is really important.

7
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,770
This village is in the center of this area that is the blue zone.	Okay.

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:01:01,620
So, if I want to pick all the village where we saw high longevity, I will say that all these village are included,

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,270
also these one here, and these one here.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,200
So you have, really, an area like this, you see, where the longevity is the highest.

11
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,040
And when I did it for the first time I put it in blue.

12
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:23,660
So this is, really, the highest blue zone of Sardinia, while this area, the mountain around, is a bit lower longevity.

13
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,010
It's a lower blue zone. You see? And the rest of the country is not a blue zone, without longevity.

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,370
But this is really the main area of longevity.?

15
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:40,180
Interviewer: So tell me, Michael, where did it start personally, this search for [longitivity 00:01:41] But this is really the main area of longevity.?

16
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:40,510
But this is really the main area of longevity.?

17
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,210
Micheal Poulain: In fact, there is two step.

18
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:52,210
First I was, for the first time involved in centenarian study in Belgium in '92 with my friend,

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,860
so I was already in the field of centenarian.

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:07,390
But this story here, in the whole Sardinia, started in Montpelier in October 1999, and that was because my friend,

21
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,180
my new friend Gianni Pes, a medical doctor from Sassari arrive

22
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:19,880
and explain that in this area men are living as long as women, what is really exceptional,..

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,850
but nobody wanted to believe this. So, they decide .. I remember this meeting October where the are .. Oh you are too ...? and explain that in this area men are living as long as women, what is really exceptional,..

24
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,850
but nobody wanted to believe this. So, they decide .. I remember this meeting October where the are .. Oh you are too ...?

25
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,870
Interviewer: What's your personal fascination for [longitivity 00:02:33] but nobody wanted to believe this. So, they decide .. I remember this meeting October where the are .. Oh you are too ...?

26
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,200
but nobody wanted to believe this. So, they decide .. I remember this meeting October where the are .. Oh you are too ...?

27
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,060
Micheal Poulain: It's clear that if you have a place where men have the possibility to live as long as women,

28
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,540
this is unique on Earth because everywhere on Earth women are, I would say, five times,

29
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,110
ten times in larger number compared to men. And in this area, you have equal number.

30
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,820
So you have something to find, something to explain, and this is unique.

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,950
It's the only place on Earth where I saw this type of specificity.

32
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,610
Interviewer: And where comes your personal fascination?

33
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,090
Micheal Poulain: It's clear that longevity fascinate me, but to be-

34
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,610
Interviewer: Why?

35
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:14,620
Micheal Poulain: Why? Because for everybody living longer is something very attractive.

36
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,850
And the recipe to live longer and the secret of longevity, look in all the newspaper, in all the National Geographic,

37
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,430
it attracts so many person.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,880
When I do a conference on longevity everybody is there attending the conference very happy to listen,

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,130
what are the secret of longevity?

40
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:37,730
Interviewer: And why are you fascinated by longevity? Personally.

41
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,420
Micheal Poulain: I don't want to live to 100, okay?.

42
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:48,280
But this is a very attractive topic, and suddenly, I don't know why.. Micheal Poulain: I don't want to live to 100, okay?.

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,360
Micheal Poulain: I don't want to live to 100, okay?.

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,410
I was already in the field of centenarian, but if there is a secret you have to find it on the scientific viewpoint.

45
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,310
You have to find something. And it's a question. I name it a longevity quest.

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,330
How can we explain that in this place men are living as long as women,

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,340
and there are so many centenarian in the cemetery? Why? That's the question.

48
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,740
Interviewer: That I understand. But what's your personal quest in this one?

49
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,260
Micheal Poulain: I am a scientist, okay, which mean that I need challenge.

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,190
And I understand not only that I was personally interested,

51
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,770
but that a lot of people in the scientific world are interested with that topic.

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:41,130
It's a very attractive topic even among scientist. And we have no question.

53
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,950
And I will say that at the end of the day, I like to do it because it's interdisciplinary approach.

54
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,610
The secret of longevity is not only in one field, in nutrition, in sociology, in anthropology, no.

55
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:04,670
It has to bring together all people to try to find the solution. And the solution here is not a simple one.

56
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:12,970
If you find me a gene that explain 10% of the super-longevity, I say, I will not be satisfy.

57
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:22,550
We have to find why here there are three times or four times more men reaching 90 and 100 than everywhere else.

58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,250
That's not a small difference. This is a big difference. And up to now, we are not yet there.

59
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,430
The question is still open, and I will say that for a scientist, when question are still open, it's better than

60
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,560
when question are solve.

61
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:45,020
I will say that there is something to find, and that's what researcher wants to do, to find new line.

62
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,150
And if we find something then we'll be very happy, but maybe then it will be finish for my career.

63
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,480
Interviewer: This is the story the centennials from the past, in a way.

64
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,520
We are coming into future where many more people are getting much more older.

65
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,370
Every four years we gain one year, I believe.

66
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,370
Micheal Poulain: Yeah.

67
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:21,850
Interviewer: How do you see that, the new centennials that are not, like, grown up here in Sardinia

68
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,350
but are the centennials from the future? How do you see those developments?

69
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:32,480
Micheal Poulain: In fact, you have to understand that centennarian that we met here, and we are still looking today,

70
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:40,950
are exceptional person. They were a person that has very difficult life in their early life. They have to work hard.

71
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,730
They were pastore and so on, and when they were 60 or 70, at that moment they should have some problem with health,

72
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,000
but then the health service was improve.

73
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,520
Which mean in the 50, in the 60, they have the possibility to go to hospital, they have a maternity,

74
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,790
they have a lot of thing, so this is the conjunction of two change.

75
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,540
The fact that the old generation still work a lot, and did a lot of effort and caloric restriction and so on,

76
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:18,020
and that the modern world arrive with health and so on. And my feeling is that these centennarian are not by hazard.

77
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,600
They are the result of these two dimension.

78
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,970
In future, like it is in our country, the centennarian will be more random centennarian, by hazard.

79
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,000
People that escape to this or delay these type of disease and so on.

80
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:40,930
So the future centennarian will not be the same as the one we can see in this village.	I have already seen the

81
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,580
situation in Okinawa.

82
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:49,020
In Okinawa there is no more new centennarian coming in large number because since '45,

83
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,840
the American arrive there with the modern life style and so on, so the situation for the new generation change fully.

84
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,390
And I'm sure that in future the longevity, exceptional longevity of Okinawa will disappear.

85
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:13,160
And this is my problem here, the young generation, if the young generation will transfer this treasure of longevity.

86
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,870
In all my talk in the municipality I say,

87
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,740
the most important is to understand that you have a treasure with this longevity.

88
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,080
Your lifestyle, your food, all what is around you, you have to keep it

89
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,990
and to transfer to the new generation so that you will keep this longevity.

90
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,430
If not, you will be as a very rare, some random centennarian,

91
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,600
and nobody will take care of these person because they will be lost in the society,

92
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,840
in the modern society that does not take care about the whole person.

93
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,280
So that situation is fully different, and what we try to do, for example, now in the US,

94
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,580
and they try to do it also in Costa Rica is to take the lesson from these area and to transfer in the modern world.

95
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:04,980
Not to say, okay, go as shepard in Sardinia. No. This is not possible. But look at what you are eating. Do exercise.

96
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:13,820
Don't stop to do this physical exercise. Your brain, social relationship, take care of the old person, and so on.

97
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:20,120
All those point emerging from the lesson of this blue zone could be transferred to our society,

98
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:30,890
and this is the challenge. So our work here is not only for a very local, exceptional situation..

99
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,650
It's to see what are these people .. What is their behavior that can be transfer for the whole modern society. and this is the challenge. So our work here is not only for a very local, exceptional situation.

100
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,020
It's to see what are these people .. What is their behavior that can be transfer for the whole modern society.

101
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,210
And in the US, this is very important against obesity, against a lot of thing like that.

102
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:53,700
And in our European country the same because people nowaday at 90 or 95 they are put on the side just to wait to die.

103
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,450
This is not correct. Here, the centennarian are on the top of the agenda. They are the keepers They stay in the family.

104
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,370
They are on the calendar in the municipality. They are in the photography and so on.

105
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,130
So, the role of the oldest old here is fully different. And this is what we can do in our modern society.

106
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:20,090
Interviewer: What would that mean for our society if would embrace that more?

107
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:27,090
Micheal Poulain: It means, for example, that to put people suddenly in the nursing home,

108
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,570
it is consider in our society as the place where you will go to die. This is not correct.

109
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,600
I have seen, also in the US, place where you may enter in a nursing home but by step.

110
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,680
You go first in the part where you stay with your spouse, then

111
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:52,360
when the spouse disappear you go to another place in the same surrounding, and if suddenly you became dependent,

112
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,550
you go still in another place. But you are in a surrounding where you don't change.

113
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,160
The main problem nowaday, I have seen it in my country, you have a problem of heath,

114
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:11,820
then quickly with your children we have to take a decision, Papi or Mami has to go to a nursing home

115
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,710
and not given a selected nursing home. They have to go in the only one that has available.

116
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,850
I have the case in my family, one uncle has to go there suddenly, within two weeks. This is not correct.

117
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,090
What I name the last migration, the migration to the nursing home,

118
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:44,690
is the worst that can be expected by a person.	During the life course, the lower level of mobility is between 65

119
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,730
and 75. At that moment, nobody wants to move.

120
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,790
But after that, there is what I name the last migration, the migration when you are unhealthy, you are dependent,

121
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,880
either you go to your children, you go to nursing home, and so on.

122
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,850
But in our country we don't go anymore to the children because the parents and the children does not want.

123
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,880
The children are not available, and the parents don't want to [inaudible 00:12:09] their parents,

124
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,250
so you go to nursing home.

125
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,920
In my country, three fourth of the oldest old are in nursing home, but all the nursing home are not the same.

126
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:27,550
You have to know there are some nursing home that are fully appropriate, but most of them are not at all.

127
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,790
Interviewer: What are they doing here?

128
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,930
Micheal Poulain: They have no nursing home here. There is nobody in nursing home.

129
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:38,540
What is the situation in this area is that you are close to your neighbor, your are close to your family,

130
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,660
your daughter is living with you or in the neighboring house.

131
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,550
For example, Marco, here, is going to spend the night with his uncle once or twice a week.

132
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,380
There is a solidarity, full solidarity in the village, and nobody in nursing home.

133
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,260
Interviewer: You are in the explorer.

134
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,070
Micheal Poulain: Yeah.

135
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,410
Interviewer: That's the archetype..

136
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,210
Micheal Poulain: Mm-hmm (affirmative) Interviewer: That's the archetype..

137
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,480
Interviewer: That's the archetype..

138
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,630
Interviewer: Scientifically seen, what makes you an explorer?

139
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:12,750
Micheal Poulain: I will say that I like to enter in a field that is not usual for other scientist.

140
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,790
Very often I see that colleagues will jump on a topic that is already [treaten 00:13:20] by other scientists,

141
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,560
and just they add a small information..

142
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,370
In this topic, it's a new one, fully new one, and it's difficult because you have.. and just they add a small information..

143
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:32,450
and just they add a small information..

144
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,570
It took me years to prove that it's a very important topic, but nowaday, I have seen it this week,,

145
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,970
this three meeting that I have just beginning of this month. It took me years to prove that it's a very important topic, but nowaday, I have seen it this week,

146
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,840
I have a meeting in [Talin 00:13:43] in Vienna, and in [Portu 00:13:44] this three meeting that I have just beginning of this month. It took me years to prove that it's a very important topic, but nowaday, I have seen it this week.

147
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,970
this three meeting that I have just beginning of this month. I have a meeting in [Talin 00:13:43] in Vienna, and in [Portu 00:13:44]

148
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:44,160
this three meeting that I have just beginning of this month.,.

149
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:51,890
At the three meetings there were a lot of interest to this new concept, and that bring me the feeling that, okay,

150
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:59,510
it was difficult to convince people, convince researcher that this is a very useful topic, but after some times

151
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:08,240
when you keep it, you succeed. In all my career I did not want to have a easy way.

152
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,520
You make sure it's more difficult way, but at the end of the day you may succeed, and that,

153
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,890
it's really wonderful to see reaction of researcher and so on. That's very important.

154
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,590
Interviewer: And what topic are we talking about?.

155
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,260
Micheal Poulain: We are talking about.. Interviewer: And what topic are we talking about?.

156
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,520
Interviewer: And what topic are we talking about?.

157
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,290
Interviewer: Sorry.

158
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:30,340
[inaudible 00:14:23] So, could you explain me again, why is, scientifically seen, the archetype explorer fit for you?

159
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:38,910
Micheal Poulain: I will say that, among the scientist, there are very often different opportunity.

160
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,240
One opportunity is to jump in a topic that is already on the agenda of a lot of researcher,

161
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,870
and then you deal with the same thing, you try to do a new experiment, to replicate as we say,

162
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,900
and you bring some small additional information.

163
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,240
Another situation is when you develop and you enter in a new field, in a new topic, and that's what I did here.

164
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:06,430
At the beginning, putting on the table of the scientist a new topic, a new idea,

165
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,380
a new concept is really disturbing for two reason: they don't believe, or they are jealous. That's the two reason.

166
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,940
So, for me, I have a lot of difficulty, but I keep the line, and I may say that after 15 years,

167
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,090
now everybody respect this new concept of population longevity, the fact that blue zone are something very interesting,,

168
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,280
and there is something to take from this. now everybody respect this new concept of population longevity, the fact that blue zone are something very interesting,,

169
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,080
And I have a meeting at the beginning of the month in [Talin 00:15:32] then in Vienna, and in [Porto 00:15:34] and there is something to take from this. now everybody respect this new concept of population longevity, the fact that blue zone are something very interesting,

170
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,290
and there is something to take from this.,, And I have a meeting at the beginning of the month in [Talin 00:15:32] then in Vienna, and in [Porto 00:15:34]

171
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:34,450
and there is something to take from this.,,

172
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,410
and at the three meeting I talk about blue zone, and there were a lot of interest.

173
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,310
And people want really to know, what is specific in this blue zone, what do you bring as new information?

174
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:53,790
So, it's difficult in the career, but when you are explorer you go in an unknown world. And that's, for me, attractive.

175
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,550
You discover a place where there are no other scientist already in the field.

176
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,930
It's difficult, but then it brings you a lot of, I will say, positive sensation.

177
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:09,090
Interviewer: What are the blue zones in the world? Where are the blue zones?

178
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:17,250
Micheal Poulain: The blue zone, now we have four blue zone: Okinawa, Ikariai in Greece, Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica,

179
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,650
and Sardinia. And now I am always working on the possibility to find new blue zone.

180
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:31,260
So I have been last month in Caucasus, in Georgia, and I visited a hidden valley that was supposed to be wonderful.

181
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,090
That has been said in the past, in the Caucasus there are people living longer, so I went there.

182
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:47,340
It was attractive on anthropological viewpoint, but I visited six centennarian and I did survey, I checked the archive,

183
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,830
and at the end of my day, I have to consider that all of them exaggerate their age.

184
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,580
So, in fact, my conclusion is that there is no exceptional longevity in Caucasus. So I close the door.

185
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,590
Caucasus can not be a new blue zone. Now I have another one on the agenda. This is Cuba.

186
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,110
And Cuba, I'm sure there is something.

187
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,270
I'm sure there is place, and I have seen the place nearby Santa Clara where there is a lot of centennarian.

188
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:21,620
I visited them on the cemetery, I have some contact with the data, but to prove that this is a blue zone,

189
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,700
I need strong statistical data. That's very important. And these data are not available, that's the problem.

190
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,350
Because the government of Cuba did not give the green light.

191
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,310
You see, in Cuba, if you don't have a sign from the top,

192
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,690
you will not have access to data that are a bit more sensitive. And so I am waiting. The door is open.

193
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,750
But what is important, if I succeed to prove that Cuba is a blue zone,

194
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:57,120
with a health expenditure that is 1,000 less than in the US, to go in US and to tell it,

195
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,450
you need to have strong argument. You need to have strong evidence.

196
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,240
So I will not do it until I have my data and my proof.

197
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,600
But if it's so,

198
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:15,420
it will be a boom because you may show that you may reach 100 in large number in a country where you give only some

199
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,220
small preventive and no all these technical of medicine, the new medicine.

200
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,360
And no psychiatry, no psycholog, a lot of thing are missing in Cuba,

201
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,640
and the longevity is there.	I have seen centennarian that has no freezer at home.

202
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,330
There is no possibility to keep the food. And they give me an ananas, and I never ate so wonderful ananas.

203
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,510
The sofa are just piece of wood. The house is piece of wood, but the smile, honestly, wonderful.

204
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:56,580
Children smiling all over the world, these are not the one that are in the richer country. That's important.

205
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,160
Interviewer: Not in the richer countries.

206
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,830
Micheal Poulain: No.

207
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,860
Interviewer: Do you want to be a centennarian?

208
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,400
Micheal Poulain: No.

209
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,120
Interviewer: Why not?

210
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Micheal Poulain: I have another viewpoint. All depends what you are doing in one day, okay?

211
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:19,090
And I understand that some people at the end of the day may not conclude that they did something on that day.

212
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,900
When I see all what I am trying to do in one day, sometime it's so heavy, and so full,

213
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,470
that I think it's impossible to reach 100 like this..

214
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,890
So, seem that there is a different speed or a different level of activity and so on, so that finally .. that I think it's impossible to reach 100 like this..

215
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,010
that I think it's impossible to reach 100 like this..

216
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:46,380
I know some singers die at 50, but they have a full life, full, full, full, while other person die after 100

217
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,480
and did nothing alongside their life. So you see, there is a balance.

218
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:59,200
When you are doing study on the oldest old, you have all the same time the idea, I will be there soon,

219
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,980
and that brings me a lot of thought, sometimes negative, so I have to fight against the negative,

220
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:14,220
but I have seen these person. I saw the person 116. She is alone all the day. I saw the mother-in-law of my brother.

221
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,150
She is 101. And then I discuss with her, and I say, when you are awake during the night, what is in your brain?

222
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,890
And then she say, very simply, "I am praying.

223
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:34,050
Nothing else." But for me it's a question, what is going on in the brain of these person that are awake

224
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:44,470
and alone a full day. And is it depression or they are just looking on their life and pray, as she say, she pray.

225
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,770
That's very important.

226
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:54,270
And for me it put question because the longevity is in front of all of us, why marriage, children and so on,

227
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,140
this is beyond, but longevity is in front.

228
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Interviewer: What is, for you, the most beautiful thing?

229
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:16,750
Micheal Poulain: I will say spontaneously, the moment that I prefer when I feel really the most happy,

230
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:27,400
it's two different thing. When I see the smile of a small child in a hidden country and so on, smiling.

231
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:33,930
I have photography of children that are so wonderful. Or, when I see a landscape like this, very quiet.

232
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:40,580
And some landscape I have been, for example, in India, in Kashmir and so on, you have this so beautiful landscape,

233
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,480
and then the problem of my fate erase, and I say, it's so beautiful.

234
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,780
And for me these are the most important moment in my life, to see those children

235
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,080
and the wonderful landscape that God give us, and that's very important.

236
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,420
Interviewer: Shall we every reach 200?

237
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:10,380
Micheal Poulain: I will say that Aubrey de Grey wanted to say that we will reach easily 150, 200, and even 1,000 years.

238
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,040
I am not convince.

239
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,320
Because he say that with the new medicine, you may repair everything on your body,

240
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:25,770
but I will say that if you have a car, and the tire is flat, you repair it, but if it is an old tire,

241
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:32,230
then you will have a new problem just a bit later. I think it's a dream.

242
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:39,230
And this is a point that we are discussing very often between scientists, is it an upper limit of the life,

243
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,110
or it will be an open door to 1,000 years old. I am convince that there is an upper limit.

244
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,490
And nowaday, people does not reach more than 116; 117 is the maximum.

245
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:02,940
And Jeanne Calment, who was 122, there is no chance that she will be replaced very soon. That's my point.

246
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:11,330
But this is a very big competition between different theory of demographer because some of these say, okay,

247
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,290
there is no limit and others say there is a limit, and that's important.

248
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,530
Interviewer: And when there is no limit?

249
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,890
Micheal Poulain: When there is no limit, it will being that there could be a person who will reach 140.

250
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,370
But to reach 140 you need to have a number of centennarian that is very,

251
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,790
very large because the probability to reach 140 is very low.

252
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,530
So the more you have centennarian, the more you will have the possibility to go to a higher age.

253
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,080
And that's why in France, for example, they have more centennarian, and they reach 115.

254
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,730
In Belgium it's more difficult; we reach only one and twelve.

255
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,360
In the Netherlands you have a person who have reached 115, but this is occasionally.

256
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,160
It's not due to the fact that you have a large number of centennarian, but this random.

257
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:03,130
So, I think, we discussed just recently, to reach higher age, you need, really, a larger number of centennarian.

258
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,550
And at one moment,

259
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:12,970
the total population on Earth is not enough so that you will have the possibility to have one person, for example, 150.

260
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:19,010
So this is a question.	So, on a probability viewpoint, it's possible,

261
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,340
but you need to apply this probability to a initial number of person,

262
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:34,690
and the nine billion of population on Earth are not enough to get one person reaching 140 or 150. That's the point.

263
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,690
Crew: That's not bad. [inaudible 00:24:40]

264
00:24:36,690 --> 00:25:04,330
Interviewer: When you look at that village and the next village we are going to,

265
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,310
what's happening in the blue zone area?

266
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:15,790
Micheal Poulain: So, in fact, we will going from village to village, and when you have a new village like this one,

267
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,080
then you have to assess the level of longevity in this village,

268
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,040
and to assess if the level is high enough to be a blue zone.

269
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,300
So now we will check this village, and then we will go to another one, and finally

270
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:35,450
when we were able to put on a map all these village, we form, really, an area that we name the blue zone.

271
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,850
That's very important.

272
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,580
Interviewer: When you look at that village, is that a blue zone village?

273
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,710
Micheal Poulain: This village is part of the blue zone, yes.

274
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,210
Interviewer: Proven.

275
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,690
Micheal Poulain: Yeah, it's proven. That mean that we have already checked the data.

276
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:54,640
The next one, it will be also on the same situation. So we have fourteen village that has been composing the blue zone.

277
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,340
One by one we put them together.

278
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:02,680
Interviewer: And when you look at villages that are not blue zone, the non-fourteen that are around here,?

279
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,350
what's the difference between ... Interviewer: And when you look at villages that are not blue zone, the non-fourteen that are around here,?

280
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,690
Interviewer: And when you look at villages that are not blue zone, the non-fourteen that are around here,?

281
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,300
Micheal Poulain: I will say that there is not a clear, quick difference.

282
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,270
It's a gradient,

283
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,230
which mean that at one moment you have to do the border to identify what is the real restricted blue zone,

284
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:24,170
the high blue zone, and then you have a light blue zone all around that is all the mountains part of Sardinia.

285
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:31,650
And the rest of Sardinia, including Sassari, including Cagliari, Oristano, all the city, this is the non-blue zone.

286
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:37,320
Interviewer: And what makes it that they are not able to be blue?

287
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,270
Micheal Poulain: This is the level of longevity,

288
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,490
the number of centennarian that you found divided by the number of new born one century ago.

289
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,880
In these village is really lower..

290
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,090
Interviewer: And is that because of different life? Of different .. In these village is really lower..

291
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,270
In these village is really lower..

292
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,990
Micheal Poulain: That's really the question mark.

293
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:02,580
Now, the fact that we identify a blue zone and a non-blue zone, now we are comparing the lifestyle, the food,

294
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:09,940
the environment, everything in the two part, and then we will see what are the biggest difference.

295
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,920
I already understood that one of the big difference is the proportion of shepard, so the role of shepard in the past,

296
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:24,050
because in the mountain, most ancestor of these people were shepard. If you go to the plain, there was no shepard.

297
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,310
This is not the same.

298
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,490
They are doing agriculture, they are growing cereal and so on, this is not the same way of living..

299
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,300
Interviewer: So that's the difference between .. They are doing agriculture, they are growing cereal and so on, this is not the same way of living..

300
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:33,350
They are doing agriculture, they are growing cereal and so on, this is not the same way of living..

301
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,930
Micheal Poulain: That's the main difference for us up to now..

302
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:42,480
That's why the blue zone is concentrated in the area where you have this pastoralism, where you have .. Micheal Poulain: That's the main difference for us up to now..

303
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,640
Micheal Poulain: That's the main difference for us up to now..

304
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,990
Everybody is working on the animals in the mountain.

305
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,280
Interviewer: That's in Sardinia?

306
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,000
Micheal Poulain: That's in Sardinia, yes.

307
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:55,880
And then it may be that you have the same in other country, but this is a question mark.

308
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:03,620
Which mean that, is it normal that with the same proportion of shepard in another country we don't have the longevity,

309
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,200
so this is a question mark, okay?

310
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,530
Interviewer: So, it's good to be a shepard.

311
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,880
Micheal Poulain: If you come to be shepard here, I'm not sure you will live longer.

312
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:22,970
Because you should be born here, you should live exactly as they live here, so it's a very complex thing.

313
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,330
So I don't recommend to come here to be shepard. First of all, nobody is shepard nowaday.

314
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,640
There are limited number of shepard. That's clear.

315
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,470
Interviewer: Tell me, the village behind you, is that a blue zone village?

316
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,210
Micheal Poulain: This village is part of the blue zone, which mean that we have been there, we check the data,

317
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,280
and we prove that the level of longevity in this village is really higher than Italian average.

318
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,330
There is a huge difference between the two.

319
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:59,220
So, we put it on the map, and putting all the village together we shape the blue zone,

320
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,310
and so this village is part of the blue zone.

321
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,400
Interviewer: Where does the name "blue zone" come from?

322
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,020
Micheal Poulain: Ah.

323
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:12,400
So, the first time that we went from village to village, at one moment I decide to put on a maps all the village,

324
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,010
and I mark in blue all the village.

325
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,500
So it was a blue area on the map, then I decide with Gianni that it was the blue zone.

326
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,530
And from that time, when we were discussing between us, we always talk about the blue zone.	See,

327
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:42,480
this is a girl who died just at 100 and a few day, 14 day, 100 and a few day there. Mulas Leonarda.

328
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,560
Interviewer: How many centennials are lying here?

329
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:53,280
Micheal Poulain: A priory, you may find in the whole cemetery 30 at least, plus those who are alive,

330
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,210
and plus those who die outside of the village, in total you have more than 42 centennarian.

331
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,470
And among the 42, there are 22 male, and that's terrifically exceptional.

332
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,020
Usually you should find, among the centennarian, eight women for one man only.

333
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,410
Here you have the same number, that's crazy. I have another one here, look. This one, for example.

334
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:29,310
You see Fortunato, he is exactly, he was 101 when he die. And this is a man. This is a girl. You see?

335
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:36,800
But we should do an itinerary in the cemetery to show all those who are so age..

336
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:48,180
Look here, you have again this is 89, this is 90, and it's always like this. 82, 86, and look, this is 92 .. No, 98. But we should do an itinerary in the cemetery to show all those who are so age..

337
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,850
Look here, you have again this is 89, this is 90, and it's always like this. 82, 86, and look, this is 92 .. No, 98.

338
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,520
98.

339
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,090
This is, for me, when I visit a cemetery I want to feel this,

340
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,770
and if I come here I will directly say there is something to do, some research. Look, this one is 87..

341
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,970
And then you have everywhere .. 88. Usually the normal age of death is around 80, 82 and so on. and if I come here I will directly say there is something to do, some research. Look, this one is 87..

342
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:16,550
And then you have everywhere .. 88. Usually the normal age of death is around 80, 82 and so on.

343
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:24,620
When you start to have a lot of nonagerian or something like that, then it's really amazing, and then you say, okay,

344
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,430
it's worth to start the research to understand what happens here. And here I discover it directly.

345
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,810
And my friend who work with me is a specialist of cemetery.

346
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,710
He is jumping in all the cemetery,

347
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,580
and once he was even blocked in the cemetery because they closed the door at four o'clock,

348
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,380
and he was not able to go out.

349
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:49,350
But he did systematically all the cemetery of the surrounding to check those who reach 90, and that's very useful.

350
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,380
Interviewer: How many people died since you were last here?

351
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,790
Micheal Poulain: During one year?

352
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,040
Interviewer: No, the last time you were here.

353
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:04,470
Micheal Poulain: Since I was there beginning of March, there is 10 people who die, and among these there are four

354
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:16,770
or five nonagerian who die above 90, and only one who die younger, 70. But I will say that it's all above 85. Okay.

355
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,920
But, at the same time, you have very limited number of new born,

356
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,290
which mean that the population of the village is definitively going down quite quickly by natural increase,

357
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,780
negative natural increase.

358
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:35,200
And as there is no immigration because the young people here, one out of two decide to leave the village,

359
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,430
so the population of the village is going down slowly and slowly. Every year you have less and less people.

360
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,580
That's a problem for the survival of these type of place because more death than new born

361
00:32:48,850 --> 00:41:42,810
and more emigration than immigration. That's okay.
