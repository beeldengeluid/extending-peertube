1
00:00:00,5 --> 00:00:06,16
When I was Professor Charles Spence an experimental psychologist. I work in Oxford University.

2
00:00:06,92 --> 00:00:14,72
And there on cross modal research laboratory. Have been for the last seventeen years or so a lab that brings together.

3
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:22,91
Psychologists food scientists chefs composers fashion designers marketeers are all brought together to look at their

4
00:00:22,91 --> 00:00:31,99
how the senses interact and apply the latest insights from brain science to the real world. So how do you know your.

5
00:00:33,99 --> 00:00:37,79
Work or cross model Research Laboratory as a name for the lab

6
00:00:39,3 --> 00:00:44,72
or research laboratory I guess you get across my little bit is a cross between

7
00:00:44,81 --> 00:00:50,83
and modal all the senses that's caught between the senses and how I want to sense can affect another sense.

8
00:00:50,99 --> 00:00:59,32
So if I add a certain fragrance it make make people look more attractive if I change the sound of the crunch it may

9
00:00:59,64 --> 00:01:04,08
change the feel of the crisp visual examples of cross sensory across modal research.

10
00:01:04,31 --> 00:01:08,95
And I want to call these so-called you know your senses what you call this field.

11
00:01:11,4 --> 00:01:15,57
Various names for the sorts of the so rare but there could be a multi sensory perception

12
00:01:15,57 --> 00:01:26,65
and multi sensory integration multisensory research. Is kind of a common term. Always what you're doing. Was my thing.

13
00:01:27,21 --> 00:01:36,58
I guess since undergraduate here back in nineteen eighty something I had to do a project for my undergraduate degree

14
00:01:36,78 --> 00:01:40,91
and didn't really have any idea and earth things that interested me at the time

15
00:01:40,94 --> 00:01:43,43
but somebody put me on to this guy who had a broken T.V.

16
00:01:43,94 --> 00:01:47,69
and For my first project my first experiments were about sort of a breaking televisions

17
00:01:47,69 --> 00:01:50,13
and moving the sounds so I didn't come from the T.V.

18
00:01:50,13 --> 00:01:55,32
They came from somewhere else and just seeing how that impacted people's ability to perceive what was being said

19
00:01:55,32 --> 00:01:59,84
and where they thought things were happening. I don't know that the yeah.

20
00:02:00,38 --> 00:02:08,35
So you can imagine a little apartment or flat bed in the south side of Oxford and you have a T.V.

21
00:02:08,35 --> 00:02:14,34
and Some people come around to watch a movie that could create start rolling and years automatic music.

22
00:02:15,44 --> 00:02:20,31
Everything seems fine and then once the critics of finished and the first actor starts to speak.

23
00:02:20,74 --> 00:02:24,04
Suddenly there's a disconnect because you see their lips moving on the screen

24
00:02:24,21 --> 00:02:26,03
but the horse is coming from the loudspeaker over there.

25
00:02:26,94 --> 00:02:32,26
Your brain says what's going on my senses are coordinated there's like a moment of sort of stopping

26
00:02:32,26 --> 00:02:33,64
and trying to figure out what is going on.

27
00:02:34,33 --> 00:02:38,69
But then a few minutes later suddenly your brain puts it all back together again.

28
00:02:39,1 --> 00:02:44,49
And you start to hear the voices as if they're coming from the lips on the screen that we have a ventriloquist dummy

29
00:02:44,49 --> 00:02:45,00
illusion

30
00:02:46,53 --> 00:02:51,18
and Michael research was looking at that sort of situation how it is that your brain to tax discrepancy between where

31
00:02:51,18 --> 00:02:54,61
it sees things and hears things that high puts it all back together again.

32
00:02:54,88 --> 00:03:00,52
And that is a multisensory perception of multi-sensory integration as I take a voice that I hear over here which I

33
00:03:00,52 --> 00:03:05,55
think belongs in the voice of the lips I see on the screen over there. And your brain can I can use them back together.

34
00:03:06,95 --> 00:03:12,63
And that is the topic of my study and over the years I started on hearing and vision back in the late eighty's

35
00:03:13,03 --> 00:03:16,05
and over the years I brought in the sense of touch and then mood

36
00:03:16,05 --> 00:03:21,63
and everything we can think about doing in the sense of touch. Then come smell that comes taste and pain and so on so.

37
00:03:21,75 --> 00:03:32,84
Adding senses to the portfolio as the years go by so fast and hard to say depends who you ask if you are.

38
00:03:33,11 --> 00:03:43,05
Ask the people in the lab as I do. The reverse. I just ask questions they don't have answers but at least five.

39
00:03:43,82 --> 00:03:47,37
I could find I could reference to people who say as many as forty three.

40
00:03:47,52 --> 00:03:53,86
So that's kind of the problem of definition of what is a sense certainly hearing vision touch taste

41
00:03:53,86 --> 00:03:59,69
and smell what everyone agrees on touch taste smell hearing and vision.

42
00:04:00,46 --> 00:04:03,89
One of the five basic senses that I think everyone agrees are five senses.

43
00:04:04,28 --> 00:04:11,64
Beyond that you might think about the sense of a kind of your body in space and how it's moving.

44
00:04:12,82 --> 00:04:21,3
You might think about kind of pheromone all sense of the chemical communication between creatures of the same species

45
00:04:21,69 --> 00:04:24,81
we know exists in animals maybe exists and humans maybe not.

46
00:04:25,75 --> 00:04:32,85
And from there you'll find others who will talk about pain is that a separate sense. Or is it part of touch.

47
00:04:33,93 --> 00:04:38,3
Some you might even claim as and a magnetic sense or.

48
00:04:38,44 --> 00:04:42,45
Or a sixth sense a feeling of there someone's looking at me or I know what's going on

49
00:04:43,14 --> 00:04:51,44
and the list goes on some I want to say. Something that.

50
00:04:55,82 --> 00:04:58,63
Not in the way it's used in and marketing

51
00:04:58,63 --> 00:05:03,82
and so I work with car companies that are sold like cars having her sixth sense.

52
00:05:04,89 --> 00:05:09,01
About what people normally mean by that is just kind of an increased awareness.

53
00:05:10,01 --> 00:05:14,84
Almost like a spooky awareness of I think it is quite high. You know that you know that someone is looking at you say.

54
00:05:15,43 --> 00:05:21,27
So I think we are can be pick up things and be aware of things without realizing how we know

55
00:05:21,27 --> 00:05:27,21
and sometimes information comes in not through the sense we imagine create magine we can see most of the stuff we know

56
00:05:27,21 --> 00:05:35,64
about whereas in fact maybe it's that it's a subtle smiles that can tell you whether somebody else has just come back

57
00:05:35,64 --> 00:05:39,42
from the pub always been watching a scary movie whether of you later on something else.

58
00:05:39,56 --> 00:05:45,14
These are kind of subtle cues that sometimes get dominated by the higher senses of vision

59
00:05:45,14 --> 00:05:47,64
and yet can nevertheless feed into our judgments

60
00:05:47,64 --> 00:05:57,24
and sometimes because that feeling of knowing at least translates as everybody.

61
00:06:01,76 --> 00:06:06,62
What do you think is the most important. More important.

62
00:06:08,19 --> 00:06:13,99
I think definitely is a kind of sensory hierarchy some senses are more important than others.

63
00:06:16,32 --> 00:06:18,59
Most of the research most of the writing.

64
00:06:19,47 --> 00:06:25,58
Most of our introspection tells us that vision is the dominant sense the most important one and certainly

65
00:06:25,58 --> 00:06:28,00
when you look inside the brain.

66
00:06:28,00 --> 00:06:33,7
You'll find more of the cortical real estate is given over to processing what we see down to any

67
00:06:33,7 --> 00:06:35,17
or all of the other senses.

68
00:06:35,22 --> 00:06:41,65
So the numbers from the neuroscientists would be something like fifty to fifty five more than half of your brain is

69
00:06:41,65 --> 00:06:49,11
involved in processing visual inputs from your eyes just ten fifteen percent of your brain is involved in hearing

70
00:06:49,11 --> 00:06:51,6
or in touch and eye comes to smell or taste.

71
00:06:52,01 --> 00:06:57,21
You're down to one or two percent in terms of our shop or aim is given every chance it's clear that vision dominates

72
00:06:57,21 --> 00:07:05,24
and yet most of our research last twenty years has been trying to demonstrate how important the other senses are too

73
00:07:05,24 --> 00:07:11,89
and that depending on the sub sorts of questions you ask all the situations you're in in fact what we smell what we

74
00:07:11,89 --> 00:07:12,97
hear what we feel

75
00:07:12,97 --> 00:07:18,58
and even what we taste can be far more important than we realize not just making the dominant sense

76
00:07:18,58 --> 00:07:23,03
but it means more information has more value to be had to stimulating the other senses.

77
00:07:23,68 --> 00:07:34,64
Even though we don't think about it very often we don't talk about them so much and they are of a visual. Yeah.

78
00:07:37,29 --> 00:08:04,86
So OK yes. So. And we we. It's possible to use more of our senses. Or is it. Both. So.

79
00:08:10,98 --> 00:08:16,36
Why not just stay with the visual well as a number of answers to why engaging their senses is interesting

80
00:08:16,36 --> 00:08:25,81
and ultimately important from a research trajectory so personally then there's a lot of open space to be tackled.

81
00:08:26,07 --> 00:08:30,00
There are many many very clever people who just study vision who just study hearing.

82
00:08:30,42 --> 00:08:35,9
But having so many look at have a sense is connect being that kind of jack of all trades knowing a little bit about

83
00:08:36,01 --> 00:08:40,37
each of the senses opens up a huge kind of Harry research space.

84
00:08:41,68 --> 00:08:47,09
And that's really exploded over the last quarter of a century. So important in that way but more generally.

85
00:08:50,68 --> 00:08:55,22
So I think if you go back to when I arrived in Oxford in the eighty's there were.

86
00:08:55,92 --> 00:09:00,73
There was a scientist who just next to him was a scientist who just started hearing.

87
00:09:01,28 --> 00:09:05,56
And they haven't spoken to each other for you know decades literally that some falling out.

88
00:09:06,29 --> 00:09:11,23
And neither thought that they lost anything by not speaking to it or I can just focus on them for my whole life.

89
00:09:11,38 --> 00:09:15,98
That's all I need to know about what that guy over there does is irrelevant to me it's a different sense.

90
00:09:17,55 --> 00:09:18,28
So I think was

91
00:09:18,28 --> 00:09:24,03
or was coming up we've seen since sort of the seventy's as people start to get interested in how the senses interact

92
00:09:24,91 --> 00:09:30,66
normally hearing and vision it's the easiest to study the most commonly studied these the higher the rational senses.

93
00:09:31,25 --> 00:09:36,84
Then as the years go by people start to bring in touch as a spatial sense tells us where things are.

94
00:09:37,82 --> 00:09:45,48
I know only then do you find the only of the last in this century. Do you find people looking at smell and taste.

95
00:09:46,37 --> 00:09:52,00
Why because they are maybe sort of harder to study your subjects adapt they get full up it's messy.

96
00:09:52,13 --> 00:09:53,74
I can't just put in front of a computer.

97
00:09:53,77 --> 00:09:58,17
You know where you go mixing smells and tastes and flavors and food that's much more challenging

98
00:09:58,17 --> 00:09:59,99
and requires a broader skill.

99
00:10:00,09 --> 00:10:05,42
That and for that reason it has been sort of neglected and until very recently but I see it

100
00:10:05,98 --> 00:10:11,3
and are on a mission to try and convince my colleagues that are the lower senses so-called the smell

101
00:10:11,3 --> 00:10:17,05
and taste on the touch are much more important or exciting to have a profound impact on our lives.

102
00:10:18,9 --> 00:10:24,12
My colleagues have met maybe just smile at me and maybe say now that I would stop hearing and vision

103
00:10:24,43 --> 00:10:29,42
but I have to Mystic that as years go by more and more researchers will start to engage with the other senses

104
00:10:29,42 --> 00:10:33,71
and that will be the front here that we're sort of at the moment

105
00:10:33,71 --> 00:10:37,95
and I see some of them starting to do research on taste in a way that they've never done before.

106
00:10:38,94 --> 00:10:47,82
And I see a huge kind of public interest in. Everyone likes to eat and drink. You know you think it's a folder.

107
00:10:48,68 --> 00:11:11,64
That's right. And I want to time to that we. So. I think if you go back in a way.

108
00:11:11,67 --> 00:11:14,96
So there's a few three trends kind of kind of coalescing at the same time.

109
00:11:16,06 --> 00:11:23,18
On the wall and you sort of find I think about what two thousand

110
00:11:23,18 --> 00:11:29,13
or so you'll find people saying a sensory overload is just too much information to me screens too many mobile devices

111
00:11:29,13 --> 00:11:34,89
beeping in and flashing to me videos of that's all just too much information I can't really capers

112
00:11:35,34 --> 00:11:38,15
and stressful just being anywhere but

113
00:11:38,15 --> 00:11:43,85
when you break that down what you find is it's mostly just from hearing vision is too much technology allows you to

114
00:11:43,85 --> 00:11:45,58
present more and more audiovisual stuff.

115
00:11:46,34 --> 00:11:50,95
But it doesn't do anything for your sense of touch is doing things your sense of smell or taste

116
00:11:51,85 --> 00:11:58,24
and it's that kind of realisation it's kind of sensory imbalance almost that we're overloading these higher rational

117
00:11:58,27 --> 00:12:02,92
senses at the neglect. At the cost of our more emotional senses.

118
00:12:03,56 --> 00:12:09,62
And there are some benefits each sense probably is good at delivering certain kinds of benefits or awards or

119
00:12:09,94 --> 00:12:14,56
or things making it much easier to deliver those through through touch and smell

120
00:12:14,65 --> 00:12:20,82
and maybe seas of society at large moving toward sort of aroma therapy mass arge spa treatments is going to be a growth

121
00:12:20,82 --> 00:12:28,55
area and maybe it's partly about bringing back the touch and the smell in a way it was being missed

122
00:12:28,58 --> 00:12:37,08
or lost from society at large I think also partly about the growth of the star chef and everyone loves.

123
00:12:37,56 --> 00:12:41,36
Most people love to watch cookery shows the ready kept on the television on without seeing some cookery show

124
00:12:41,36 --> 00:12:43,99
or other that's been a huge explosion of interest.

125
00:12:44,92 --> 00:12:49,96
And those chefs have over the last decade a number of them engage more with the senses

126
00:12:49,96 --> 00:12:52,96
and there was a gate with the senses but they're on T.V.

127
00:12:52,96 --> 00:12:56,38
and I thinking more how to not just engage the senses on the plate or in the glass

128
00:12:56,38 --> 00:13:03,26
but in the environments in which they serve their diners. I'm trying to figure out the sort of science behind it.

129
00:13:03,4 --> 00:13:09,56
They do into it if it artistically or science here to help support the sorts of design decisions they're making

130
00:13:09,94 --> 00:13:15,28
and then you have the rise of a kind of a millennial Zz who are from what all the marketeers will tell as they don't

131
00:13:15,28 --> 00:13:19,28
want products and things they want experiences experiences that they can share.

132
00:13:19,91 --> 00:13:26,79
And those experiences can be delivered through smell and taste and other kinds of sensory Soria.

133
00:13:27,37 --> 00:13:59,83
Sensory experiences multisensory events. Now I understand. That might die. But. So. If you give it a name and.

134
00:14:02,53 --> 00:14:19,47
Like as we are you probably knew. I certainly hope so that the kind of research we do and the people we talk to.

135
00:14:19,88 --> 00:14:25,09
Well I've become in some of them to think more carefully about how their own sense for worlds

136
00:14:25,09 --> 00:14:32,24
and how the senses are engaged in a day to day basis. I think we're seeing a bit of a shift also in a way.

137
00:14:33,2 --> 00:14:39,81
From what we've had sort of decades of what's called the Experience Economy companies brands from from Starbucks to

138
00:14:39,81 --> 00:14:40,64
Lego to Disney.

139
00:14:41,25 --> 00:14:44,08
They're not selling your product anymore they're selling you experiences

140
00:14:44,31 --> 00:14:49,01
and that's been a hugely powerful driver in marketing and you can't open a magazine

141
00:14:49,01 --> 00:14:52,71
or go into any shopping centers without somebody telling you I'm going to give you the experience.

142
00:14:55,21 --> 00:15:01,73
That experiences of a car in the city multisensory of his last few decades felt like it sort of companies who eat who

143
00:15:01,73 --> 00:15:06,66
are delivering the experience of living the senses. To us manipulate you to make you buy more.

144
00:15:07,54 --> 00:15:13,76
What's I think changing now and what I see a lot happening in the U.K. Especially in London is kind of the rise of.

145
00:15:14,75 --> 00:15:17,28
Of what some are calling kind of sense blur ration.

146
00:15:18,52 --> 00:15:24,93
I mean it's kind of it's almost like the public you and I taking control back sort of curious about our senses

147
00:15:25,65 --> 00:15:28,35
and wanting to experience more experience differently

148
00:15:29,51 --> 00:15:37,91
and this explains the rise of everything from your classical music concerts you listen to while tasting matching wines

149
00:15:38,19 --> 00:15:43,39
perf human concerts chocolate with the way that contemporary jazz

150
00:15:44,29 --> 00:15:50,35
or the Tate Museum in London last year had the tapes and sorrier for paintings from the collection that.

151
00:15:50,85 --> 00:15:51,00
Two

152
00:15:51,00 --> 00:15:57,18
or three thousand people got to to view while at the same time feeling some virtual touch smelling some perf human maybe

153
00:15:57,18 --> 00:15:59,99
even eating a chocolate. It's connecting the senses in.

154
00:16:00,01 --> 00:16:00,64
New way

155
00:16:01,99 --> 00:16:08,53
and he sort of feels like it's going the artists of the colony artists experienced designers chefs who are who are

156
00:16:08,53 --> 00:16:14,41
exploring the space and almost given the chance to to make new connections between our senses.

157
00:16:15,21 --> 00:16:20,64
Is that you know exploration rather than exploitation I guess that kind of shift I think

158
00:16:20,94 --> 00:16:30,96
and it's a shift that's also built on going from kind of obvious sensory interactions which I mean things like you go

159
00:16:30,96 --> 00:16:35,42
to the Rainforest Cafe in London and it's like a rain forest so you look at the greenery.

160
00:16:35,64 --> 00:16:43,42
And you get a thunderstorm and some rain and maybe a smell of the green notes or it's going to obvious in a way.

161
00:16:43,98 --> 00:16:45,65
Yeah I got it. Or you know it.

162
00:16:45,68 --> 00:16:48,27
It is in a lot of the top restaurants are trying to picnics in there

163
00:16:48,27 --> 00:16:51,94
and picnics that have the smell the sounds of the picnic of nature and the basket.

164
00:16:51,99 --> 00:16:54,97
Yeah it's a works and gives you all the senses it's kind of obvious

165
00:16:54,97 --> 00:17:01,94
and what's more interesting is the more kind of synesthetic. Kind of connections aren't so obvious.

166
00:17:02,07 --> 00:17:09,33
So for example that most of us will connect us with roundness.

167
00:17:09,88 --> 00:17:15,00
With pinky red color with high pitch or sweet taste with around.

168
00:17:15,16 --> 00:17:23,59
And most people say bitter tasting foods dark chocolate coffee is angular that's going to surprising almost sense that

169
00:17:23,59 --> 00:17:26,61
a connection between our senses hadn't realized yet.

170
00:17:26,66 --> 00:17:28,77
And you can ask your friends and they all say the same

171
00:17:28,77 --> 00:17:33,36
and they're also these surprising almost synesthetic connections between tastes

172
00:17:33,36 --> 00:17:39,76
and smells colors shapes textures feelings as we pick up on those new connections

173
00:17:39,76 --> 00:17:45,66
and we're in this environment where consumers want to explore the senses and we have the artists

174
00:17:45,66 --> 00:17:47,63
and the chefs who want to play

175
00:17:47,63 --> 00:17:56,15
and deliver new stuff to consumers things that really were so rich Next us for this whole new way of engaging because

176
00:17:56,15 --> 00:18:00,42
it is it's almost sense that a connection. That's why all of us need to try to. Elf.

177
00:18:01,18 --> 00:18:03,95
To see if it might to my brain work like that too.

178
00:18:04,68 --> 00:18:16,42
Or is it just jaws and what are strange connections might be there and where were the fun and the size stars.

179
00:18:17,43 --> 00:18:24,29
So it's all the same. Yeah. Where does Sirius that is. Really are so serious. Yeah and I just wonder.

180
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:34,17
I mean for the perception of people. For people to do. To join this idea.

181
00:18:35,54 --> 00:18:43,97
Just so far you can just get people and there's nothing there's no difference or you can research

182
00:18:43,97 --> 00:18:51,72
and make your own theories. About. Which model.

183
00:18:51,84 --> 00:19:03,42
Doesn't really influence the way we live and how we are in a serious way because. So so far.

184
00:19:03,72 --> 00:19:06,02
If I think sweetness is about.

185
00:19:06,3 --> 00:19:14,7
What you know of what you might do if you are a chocolate manufacturer for example

186
00:19:14,7 --> 00:19:15,95
and you're being told by government

187
00:19:15,95 --> 00:19:20,87
or out of the goodness of your own heart you think you want to reduce some of the unhealthy ingredients in the foods

188
00:19:20,87 --> 00:19:26,98
you present to the market. If I could tell you that. By making your chocolates rounder.

189
00:19:27,62 --> 00:19:33,94
They will taste sweeter to people. So you can reduce the sugar content but keep the perception the same.

190
00:19:34,3 --> 00:19:39,26
That something people might want to know about and certainly do if I can tell you from any other food

191
00:19:39,26 --> 00:19:43,76
or drink product that by changing the shape of your product out the logo on the label design.

192
00:19:43,99 --> 00:19:48,91
You can set expectations in the mind of those you're serving bacon and hands that taste perception.

193
00:19:49,46 --> 00:19:56,53
To that brand loyalty that can maybe help you to just to reduce these unhealthy ingredients by his tricks of the mind

194
00:19:56,53 --> 00:20:01,43
but it's something that you know pretty much every large food and beverage come. Is interested in.

195
00:20:02,29 --> 00:20:05,26
They know that if they actually reduce sugar of the actually reduce salt

196
00:20:05,26 --> 00:20:11,63
and fat consumers will say just stop it you're spoiling my favorite brand put back the way it was now well being told

197
00:20:11,63 --> 00:20:14,86
by government we have to do this and we need a good thing for society at large. Maybe.

198
00:20:15,36 --> 00:20:20,81
So these kind of tricks of the mind by changing the color by changing the shape by eating while listening to some sort

199
00:20:20,81 --> 00:20:22,06
of music that can bring out sweetness.

200
00:20:22,59 --> 00:20:28,77
Potentially at least offers a way of keeping everyone happy making your foods healthier.

201
00:20:29,3 --> 00:20:31,5
Without changing the taste for the consumer.

202
00:20:31,89 --> 00:20:39,1
But of course in the first instance the company will go puff ridiculous what you mean I'm not much of that round going

203
00:20:39,1 --> 00:20:46,36
taste sweeter. If you go. Up to eleven leave it surprising. So we go through. Yeah.

204
00:20:46,56 --> 00:20:49,66
So we do experiment experiment experiment publish them in scientific journals

205
00:20:49,66 --> 00:20:53,7
but no one ever reads those which is where then the interface with the chefs

206
00:20:53,7 --> 00:20:59,55
or experienced designers comes in if we can do large events where we have thousands of people coming through

207
00:20:59,55 --> 00:21:03,25
and they get to experience for themselves that when I play this music.

208
00:21:03,75 --> 00:21:09,65
What you're tasting taste sweet on a play that music suddenly taste more bitter than that's was where kind of

209
00:21:09,65 --> 00:21:10,06
convincing people

210
00:21:10,06 --> 00:21:16,52
and from that really is fun enjoyable engaging multisensory that sense permission from that that's the kind of STARTING

211
00:21:16,52 --> 00:21:20,29
POINT. To take the science that we do.

212
00:21:20,34 --> 00:21:21,55
Which means boring

213
00:21:21,55 --> 00:21:27,43
and dry put it in the hands of creative chefs for mixologists storks beers designed to turn science

214
00:21:27,43 --> 00:21:32,72
and something fun exciting enjoyable and tasty and then expose people to it

215
00:21:32,72 --> 00:21:40,43
and through that is a proof of principle that then the big brands the lions the hospital trusts come they experience it

216
00:21:40,43 --> 00:21:42,28
and they never of that do it by themselves.

217
00:21:42,81 --> 00:21:48,29
But they experience at a restaurant or in these events and then they go away and innovate and Reza case in point.

218
00:21:48,53 --> 00:21:52,18
Just take British Airways. Yeah line.

219
00:21:52,84 --> 00:21:59,93
There it's a long haul flights from eighteen months ago we were doing tastings with music for some of the.

220
00:22:00,73 --> 00:22:05,6
They came along they got it and then they went back and changed the music in the long haul flight so that

221
00:22:05,6 --> 00:22:07,19
when you order a meal in the airplane.

222
00:22:07,48 --> 00:22:09,64
You can plug into the headset in the side of your seat

223
00:22:09,85 --> 00:22:15,52
and I saw one music channel specially designed to enhance the taste of the food that they're serving so by music.

224
00:22:18,67 --> 00:22:31,53
For everybody. You. Also if you can change every every perception or every experience of one of your senses.

225
00:22:32,17 --> 00:22:49,79
Or what happens to your your feeling of truth because I know I like drug use.

226
00:22:49,81 --> 00:23:01,44
Well your idea of juggling the way and it says you like mine. So you also.

227
00:23:01,54 --> 00:23:05,84
I mean I guess what is true that we all psychologists food critic why next.

228
00:23:05,97 --> 00:23:12,9
But regular consumer like believe we can for example just taste the drink in the glass of the food on the plate

229
00:23:12,9 --> 00:23:17,92
and all of us believe that the chair you're sitting on the lighting that the music has an impact.

230
00:23:18,18 --> 00:23:22,31
Now didn't feel that way it feels like I'm tasting what's in the glass and you can't convince me otherwise.

231
00:23:22,56 --> 00:23:28,33
There are many chefs and the people we talk to who are of that opinion and intuitive glass of sherry myself

232
00:23:28,33 --> 00:23:34,41
and yet I know when we do the research and we measure how I give you a squeeze of chocolate and I say how sweet.

233
00:23:34,41 --> 00:23:39,47
Was it from one but it was very better to ten which is the sweetest chocolate you've ever had. I know that.

234
00:23:39,73 --> 00:23:45,72
I can guarantee that every single person eight out of ten say or eight hundred

235
00:23:45,72 --> 00:23:49,21
or one thousand will agree that this chocolate.

236
00:23:49,37 --> 00:23:51,64
We're going to sweeter taste sweeter to them

237
00:23:51,64 --> 00:23:57,71
when the sweet music's playing the most as we will deny that music is having an impact that also that

238
00:23:57,71 --> 00:23:59,22
when I tell have schools.

239
00:24:00,05 --> 00:24:05,22
Those My sweet music those who are busy music now see the difference and that is the proven I think in a way.

240
00:24:06,11 --> 00:24:11,51
I can't you can't turn water into wine. There are limits. So these are mostly kind of notches.

241
00:24:11,92 --> 00:24:16,73
If I give you food that's a bittersweet like dark chocolate or a black coffee with a sugar.

242
00:24:17,04 --> 00:24:18,51
I can make it ten percent sweeter.

243
00:24:18,76 --> 00:24:22,2
Or ten percent more bitter but I can give you a glass of water

244
00:24:22,3 --> 00:24:26,61
and some have changing music by changing the lighting make you think you're tasting wine or anything else.

245
00:24:26,87 --> 00:24:30,38
So there are limits to a sort of truth of your senses.

246
00:24:31,15 --> 00:24:41,61
But it's always flexible there's always modifiable but it never fully never fully you know. Because it is only.

247
00:24:44,94 --> 00:24:50,84
It's been said if it were if you take the example of the classic example of you get the wine expert

248
00:24:51,02 --> 00:24:57,72
and you get them a glass of white wine and you add some color less total US red dye. So it looks like a red wine.

249
00:24:58,19 --> 00:25:01,47
If you can convince that expert and many experts have been convinced that what they smell.

250
00:25:01,92 --> 00:25:07,35
Are all the red wine aromas that chocolate or tobacco and stone fruits that feels like feeling.

251
00:25:09,36 --> 00:25:16,12
Mixed with that red color make a smell citrus on straw or on honey on and battery notes are the red color

252
00:25:16,12 --> 00:25:18,69
and suddenly it smells completely different to the expert.

253
00:25:18,97 --> 00:25:21,51
You could call it fooling you could call it trickery

254
00:25:21,78 --> 00:25:27,58
and that maybe there is no absolute truth of our senses because we always eat

255
00:25:27,58 --> 00:25:33,61
and drink experience things in some environment in that environment whatever it is wherever we are the clothing to food

256
00:25:33,61 --> 00:25:36,64
to cocktails to coffee. To a car sales room.

257
00:25:37,84 --> 00:25:40,69
Roy getting sensory inputs and they're all really having some impact on others.

258
00:25:40,9 --> 00:25:45,93
We all deny it and it's our job kind of society as a psychologist not to believe you

259
00:25:45,93 --> 00:25:48,65
when you tell me this is what it is influencing your behavior.

260
00:25:48,69 --> 00:25:54,24
Why you like something more than another but instead to measure and observe your behavior and your performance

261
00:25:54,24 --> 00:25:59,99
and demonstrate that sometimes the way feels to us is not the way it actually is and it's to pick those examples and.

262
00:26:00,01 --> 00:26:03,09
Everyday Life. I think. You're Northern European as well.

263
00:26:03,1 --> 00:26:06,41
So you'd understand the problems all rose a paradox

264
00:26:06,41 --> 00:26:12,35
and everyone has that experience they go on holiday to the sunshine to the Mediterranean and that glass of red here

265
00:26:12,35 --> 00:26:17,2
and taste beautiful cheeses marvelous Is this the sausages are fabulous so good in fact.

266
00:26:17,23 --> 00:26:19,14
And so cheap you want to buy some and bring them back home.

267
00:26:19,49 --> 00:26:23,93
And you bring that wine back home and on a cold winter's night you open it with your friends to swish.

268
00:26:24,35 --> 00:26:26,26
Recount tales and it tastes different.

269
00:26:26,36 --> 00:26:28,63
It doesn't taste like the same wine

270
00:26:28,63 --> 00:26:34,38
and everyone is at a version of that experience in Taiwan they come to England the tea tastes amazing they take it back.

271
00:26:34,41 --> 00:26:38,07
It doesn't taste different in South America wife is from it's a cottage

272
00:26:38,07 --> 00:26:41,99
and on the Colombian coast things taste different now than they do in the capital Bogota. And I wanted to experience.

273
00:26:42,92 --> 00:26:43,52
What is it.

274
00:26:43,55 --> 00:26:47,28
It's not that the wine has changed all that has changed is the mood that you're in

275
00:26:47,28 --> 00:26:51,92
and the atmosphere in which you eat and drink. And.

276
00:26:52,6 --> 00:27:17,01
Can you say that the way we see things and is very very broken is that you know. So let's have a question. Whoa.

277
00:27:17,08 --> 00:27:20,11
Why do we need so many senses wooden just one day.

278
00:27:20,48 --> 00:27:22,27
But after five or six or seven

279
00:27:22,27 --> 00:27:28,13
or thirty forty three because you're more senses we've got more trouble your brain has trying to combine what it hears

280
00:27:28,13 --> 00:27:34,21
what it sees with what it takes so the fewer the senses the simpler the kind of computational problem to be solved.

281
00:27:34,5 --> 00:27:37,02
You might think. So there is a cost to adding more senses.

282
00:27:37,87 --> 00:27:42,04
On why do we have so many and why do we have the ones that we do.

283
00:27:42,11 --> 00:27:48,08
Well maybe it's something about you know I say Gee isn't dark ages meaning the vision wasn't so good so other senses

284
00:27:48,08 --> 00:27:53,47
came out and developed and then the lights came back on as it were and suddenly you got two senses and

285
00:27:53,47 --> 00:27:59,9
but in fact I think the real answer is that each and every one of our senses is noisy we are.

286
00:28:00,08 --> 00:28:06,56
Biological sensing system. So it's always noisy noise machine. Like a computer.

287
00:28:08,31 --> 00:28:12,04
And that noise in the system means that sometimes the thoughts alarms.

288
00:28:12,33 --> 00:28:16,76
I think I saw something that I thought I heard my name

289
00:28:16,76 --> 00:28:22,85
but no so all the time this kind of false alarms each of our senses is just noise in and sending these false alarms.

290
00:28:23,92 --> 00:28:30,8
And if we only had one sense to go on would be perpetually distracted by these laws that would actually have something

291
00:28:30,8 --> 00:28:34,89
happen. However if I think I hear something I think I saw something.

292
00:28:35,35 --> 00:28:41,32
It's very unlikely that two of my senses accidentally fired at the same time and if I thought I saw

293
00:28:41,32 --> 00:28:47,02
or heard something and they were both from the right. I think more likely so by having different senses.

294
00:28:47,86 --> 00:28:53,42
But each we assume have passed separate noise variation then by kind of pulling two senses.

295
00:28:53,69 --> 00:29:00,33
I get a much better index of what's happening in the world and can ignore more the noise of my sensory operators.

296
00:29:03,99 --> 00:29:08,48
Since you have the better in the sense that's part of the advantage of illusion really speaking

297
00:29:08,82 --> 00:29:14,66
and it also probably is the case that each of our senses is good at something

298
00:29:14,97 --> 00:29:16,65
and each of our senses is good at something different.

299
00:29:17,2 --> 00:29:23,22
So I want to know what something is where it is my eyes are as good as any sense if I want to know

300
00:29:23,22 --> 00:29:24,16
when did something happen.

301
00:29:24,84 --> 00:29:31,15
How quickly did it change my ears are much better than a mechanical rather than a chemical transduction then

302
00:29:31,15 --> 00:29:34,72
when it comes to something like. Mate selection.

303
00:29:35,86 --> 00:29:41,13
Who should I get married to or not really my nose tells me about the immune compatibility between me

304
00:29:41,13 --> 00:29:45,09
and this other person in a way that I can't see that a cop feels or smell is useful

305
00:29:45,09 --> 00:29:50,02
or smell is useful if you think about if I presented you with a plate of beautiful fish.

306
00:29:50,51 --> 00:29:54,95
It looks fabulous all the trimmings. But it just smells a bit.

307
00:29:55,18 --> 00:30:00,22
It is coughs then your nose would dominate and you would not eat that thing no matter how hard. Beautiful.

308
00:30:00,24 --> 00:30:06,81
It looks so small then becomes dominant for avoiding poisons perhaps to make make selection and taste true.

309
00:30:07,1 --> 00:30:10,43
I'm going to warn you. I'm going to get warn you.

310
00:30:10,56 --> 00:30:13,16
Or provide different kind of window into the world

311
00:30:13,16 --> 00:30:19,6
and so for you know what I want to know what should I eat what might poison me what will be neutral. If I me.

312
00:30:19,91 --> 00:30:26,45
Give me the calories and the and the protein and the minerals this taste is really the only true sense

313
00:30:26,45 --> 00:30:32,34
and picking up those qualities and yet revolution we've learned that I can't put everything into my mouth

314
00:30:32,34 --> 00:30:36,47
and seal it taste like that would be too time consuming better use my eyes.

315
00:30:36,89 --> 00:30:40,33
To predict which trees have the right Proops learn the.

316
00:30:40,94 --> 00:30:47,81
Fruits go from green and sour to read and write and then I know by looking. Where I can get the best tasting food.

317
00:30:47,91 --> 00:30:53,04
So all the senses working together and realizing that each one is dominant and good different kind of thing.

318
00:30:53,13 --> 00:31:01,76
So there's a sense. To this a sense that been there has been talk or.

319
00:31:02,34 --> 00:31:07,51
A magnetic sense that it was some some some birds maybe some other creatures have this

320
00:31:07,51 --> 00:31:10,81
and some navigate towards North know

321
00:31:10,81 --> 00:31:13,94
and you quite how it turns out that they that they have some kind of magnetic sense

322
00:31:13,94 --> 00:31:21,27
and the BE A few suggestions in the end even various team scientific journals of humans to some humans have some

323
00:31:21,27 --> 00:31:25,58
vestige of a. Magnetic sense.

324
00:31:26,44 --> 00:31:34,46
That's one that is on the cusp where would be nice if we could all have a really fully functioning magnetic sense.

325
00:31:34,68 --> 00:31:42,46
So I wouldn't need to read a map of all that stuff I could just know how to get home and leaders know that way.

326
00:31:42,51 --> 00:31:48,69
Two hundred miles. Would be great. So that would be one that we could say we miss it is clearly there.

327
00:31:48,7 --> 00:31:55,04
In other species and some of my colleagues in Germany have been trying to train us to have an extra sense.

328
00:31:55,31 --> 00:31:58,46
So they might they be putting about on people in Germany.

329
00:32:00,51 --> 00:32:07,2
So computer coding in colleagues put a belt on people and then vibrates and where it vibrates tells you where north is.

330
00:32:07,77 --> 00:32:14,04
And they get you what you wear this vibrating belt for six weeks two months with the hope being that after that time.

331
00:32:14,41 --> 00:32:15,9
You may have learnt almost

332
00:32:15,9 --> 00:32:36,07
when to put that vibration as kind of a magnetic cue we were talking about this meeting is there's no I don't need. We.

333
00:32:40,4 --> 00:32:40,71
Three.

334
00:32:45,69 --> 00:32:53,69
Oh you can you can educate the senses I suspect in this case it will always remain always feel like touch

335
00:32:54,03 --> 00:32:59,84
and they want to feel like and you sense I guess. So we can educate the senses to be better.

336
00:33:01,07 --> 00:33:05,25
Most of the research is in the case of those who've lost the sense those who are blind or deaf.

337
00:33:05,88 --> 00:33:12,78
Can they use some sort of sensory substitution system to use one of their remaining senses in order to make up for the

338
00:33:12,78 --> 00:33:17,16
loss of vision say in their tactile visual vests.

339
00:33:18,3 --> 00:33:26,24
There are glasses that have little sort of cameras on the side that may change what you see into what a sighted person

340
00:33:26,24 --> 00:33:30,23
would see they'll change it to sound the question what sort of sound should you happen.

341
00:33:30,45 --> 00:33:36,45
And those blind people who hear the world as a sighted person see do they really see.

342
00:33:37,00 --> 00:33:42,86
Or do you have to have these things in order to actually see that stuff Lear very philosophical question about what

343
00:33:42,86 --> 00:33:46,42
does it mean to see but I suspect mostly it's about.

344
00:33:47,53 --> 00:33:56,45
You can train the senses to do more stuff better stuff but it's probably impossible to to create a new science.

345
00:33:57,48 --> 00:34:03,01
Or to take what existing sense and. Turn into something else and it will always stay.

346
00:34:03,06 --> 00:34:22,02
I think it was so when we look at the reasons. Now we enter a new era where what we expect or more.

347
00:34:22,52 --> 00:34:42,04
Will be that will be in time. So looking forward and terms of how it will be sense multisensory stimulated.

348
00:34:43,85 --> 00:34:48,61
I think the answer to that question in a minute maybe partly about desire more people would like to happen

349
00:34:48,74 --> 00:34:52,88
and how they'd like their senses to be stimulated. But it's as much a matter of technology.

350
00:34:53,41 --> 00:34:55,59
How can you deliver sensations differently.

351
00:34:56,51 --> 00:35:02,88
And I think the last ten fifteen years a lot of our research on Touch say for example has been driven by the fact that

352
00:35:02,88 --> 00:35:03,8
now you know.

353
00:35:04,25 --> 00:35:12,5
Tactile technology tactile stimulation mobile devices in screens in cars where you name it is now that the technology

354
00:35:12,5 --> 00:35:19,63
exists and maybe now there are three billion fiber ating devices in people's pockets. That wasn't a cased decade ago.

355
00:35:19,94 --> 00:35:26,28
So suddenly the technologies allowed us to stimulate the skin in new ways that all these things didn't exist ten

356
00:35:26,28 --> 00:35:31,82
fifteen years ago and they ubiquitous now. So that technology allows us to simulate a sense of touch more.

357
00:35:32,52 --> 00:35:36,31
Hopefully better and the question is how what benefits can we deliver.

358
00:35:36,62 --> 00:35:43,08
Is there something about mechanical digital touch that is never the same as a real.

359
00:35:44,43 --> 00:35:49,92
Personal Touch or can we simulate it all and I suspect there may some of our research.

360
00:35:50,19 --> 00:35:55,64
I suspect suggests the stuff we read suggests that maybe you cannot simulate.

361
00:35:56,5 --> 00:35:59,87
So real touch the Midas touch the gentle casual touch.

362
00:36:00,18 --> 00:36:06,91
That will make you feel better pick up some of these change return your live reports on time big get a bigger tape that

363
00:36:06,91 --> 00:36:11,45
kind of casual touch is kind of emotional use of the sense of touch.

364
00:36:11,81 --> 00:36:20,31
You might say could I deliver that my just touch it seems to make the world a better place by by tactile vast Well

365
00:36:20,31 --> 00:36:23,35
having us. Just set up by breakers just do that. It turns out.

366
00:36:23,44 --> 00:36:32,54
No it doesn't work that seems to be something special about real human to human touch the mother's touch is kind of a

367
00:36:32,54 --> 00:36:36,46
name that. Was at my desk in my seventy touch turns to gold the.

368
00:36:36,82 --> 00:36:43,25
Way it works in the hands of social psychologists is that if. You do a study and you just gently touch somebody.

369
00:36:43,59 --> 00:36:51,67
On the shoulder be at the waitress in the restaurant the little library in the library be the person on the street then

370
00:36:51,67 --> 00:36:59,52
those who are gently touched. Who have had their eyes at Midas touch in fact show more pro-social behavior.

371
00:36:59,83 --> 00:37:06,16
So they will return alive Reeboks they will pay their fines they will give a bigger TEP they will be more social beings

372
00:37:06,16 --> 00:37:12,66
just from this into personal touch because this is kind of personal touches so beneficial in some sense.

373
00:37:13,39 --> 00:37:19,39
Those who are not developing the technology to vibrate our pockets our hands are wondering could we deliver that

374
00:37:19,39 --> 00:37:24,59
through your touch screen your your your i Pad your your mobile device.

375
00:37:25,7 --> 00:37:32,67
And it turns out so far no one's been able to do that. Maybe there's just something about real touch that's missing.

376
00:37:32,77 --> 00:37:36,65
Maybe when when you feel the touch of another person. It's got a certain speed.

377
00:37:38,02 --> 00:37:41,88
Maybe get a certain temperature and I know if I look in your and you're hairy skin.

378
00:37:42,17 --> 00:37:48,98
I know exactly the speed that your skin likes to be touched. Maybe it's not copying that who knows.

379
00:37:49,13 --> 00:37:55,46
So it's a technology that is in the world of touch and is doing that already. Then if you think about smell.

380
00:37:55,76 --> 00:38:19,87
Where are you going to. So you say well we see evidence it. In fifty years. Or we might imagine that.

381
00:38:21,97 --> 00:38:25,3
Maybe every device will have will be touch enabled in some way.

382
00:38:26,44 --> 00:38:28,28
Everything from the cutlery that you hold

383
00:38:28,31 --> 00:38:32,88
or you go to the restaurant to the car that you drive who are still driving to any.

384
00:38:35,2 --> 00:38:42,86
Phone Smartphones tablets computers. Maybe the whole B. Touch enabled. Through the chairs we sit on.

385
00:38:43,39 --> 00:38:48,38
You know you already have a massage chair so I don't like that for you because feature of any thing that they're

386
00:38:48,38 --> 00:38:53,96
actually work with love or vibrating the table so touch I think will be everywhere

387
00:38:54,17 --> 00:38:58,07
and it will be used to for a variety of purposes to transmit information.

388
00:38:58,24 --> 00:39:04,54
So everything around this very situation will.

389
00:39:07,66 --> 00:39:16,24
Or will it will give us information something or maybe any digital device will have some that we interact with.

390
00:39:17,65 --> 00:39:20,16
Will have some sort of tactile functionality.

391
00:39:21,34 --> 00:39:22,78
Not just the feel of the thing itself

392
00:39:22,78 --> 00:39:30,34
but it will be unable to vibrate to give us a Lucian's of touch to give the perception of temperature or wetness.

393
00:39:31,64 --> 00:39:32,17
For example.

394
00:39:32,69 --> 00:39:38,18
So working out with clothes companies in thinking about the transition that most people are increasingly doing their

395
00:39:38,18 --> 00:39:41,87
shopping online and that's fine for books and C.D.'s when it comes to clothing.

396
00:39:42,72 --> 00:39:45,23
Also Marc and I want to feel both average going to be like.

397
00:39:45,6 --> 00:39:50,01
Our bit less comfortable doing online coaching that there's a lot of interest in how you can.

398
00:39:50,73 --> 00:39:55,4
And able kind of technology we have a home our laptops and computers.

399
00:39:55,53 --> 00:39:59,77
Is there some way we can trick the brain into giving you the feeling of real materials.

400
00:40:00,32 --> 00:40:04,63
And by so doing kind of in crease sales of online sales of clothing and other stuff.

401
00:40:05,00 --> 00:40:09,39
So how do we virtually create touch and texture. Any kind of tribute.

402
00:40:09,84 --> 00:40:16,53
I know that if I if I give you food to eat with heavier cutlery than it will taste better to you be willing to pay more

403
00:40:16,53 --> 00:40:24,37
for it. And now somebody in Far East has created a digital fork. That by some sort of vibration and stimulation.

404
00:40:24,57 --> 00:40:25,87
It will feel have you to you.

405
00:40:26,44 --> 00:40:31,38
It's not literally have you just tricked your brain by stimulating the sense of touch in a new way to give you the

406
00:40:31,38 --> 00:40:32,19
illusion of weight.

407
00:40:32,93 --> 00:40:37,27
That something ought to be built into everything's we know already that if you see something like that a Bang

408
00:40:37,27 --> 00:40:45,09
and Olufsen remote control here let's not let's not let's not on health issue we say there's no OK.

409
00:40:45,98 --> 00:40:52,44
Everyone's going to be upset that we don't studies with certain people your books and your polls.

410
00:40:53,52 --> 00:40:58,71
And just drop a little white in the bottom of the orbit and people believe we're going to be full or soon

411
00:40:58,71 --> 00:41:03,54
or your brain can't separate the weight on the hand from the weight of the thing that's in the package.

412
00:41:04,29 --> 00:41:06,32
Have you got really helps another technology to do that.

413
00:41:06,7 --> 00:41:10,96
So I imagine any sort of advice would be thinking how do I engage more senses because this is what the sensory

414
00:41:10,96 --> 00:41:13,39
marketers are saying whatever product or service.

415
00:41:13,84 --> 00:41:19,19
You're Levering engage more of your consumer senses touch is an obvious one is it has been neglected for so long

416
00:41:19,45 --> 00:41:24,75
and yet it's sort of our biggest sense eighteen to twenty percent of our only mass given over to the skin

417
00:41:25,21 --> 00:41:33,34
and it can deliver some of the fact if I don't it benefits make us feel good if we just don't relate it right yet

418
00:41:33,34 --> 00:41:40,23
but everything you say so it's all about the benefit for.

419
00:41:41,67 --> 00:41:48,22
That I hear a lot of arguments that governments can benefit from because we can influence people.

420
00:41:51,67 --> 00:42:03,65
But what will be there all benefit for mankind and that. I think something like. Well good position.

421
00:42:03,68 --> 00:42:10,25
A lot of people are worried about their weight if I give you a simple trick to be satisfied with less food which

422
00:42:10,25 --> 00:42:14,1
involves you incurring a little lead weight around and putting it in whatever probably you're going to eat.

423
00:42:14,25 --> 00:42:18,97
That's only we can all use in an enabler for all clearly companies might use that for their own means and ends

424
00:42:19,12 --> 00:42:23,61
but it's something we cannot live inside itself it is flexible in its usage.

425
00:42:27,09 --> 00:42:34,5
And it is something anybody can apply to their daily life doesn't doesn't quite high technology does some of them some

426
00:42:34,53 --> 00:42:45,9
starting to do so you say now this year twenty sixteen will be sky books published on the topic of Bowl food eating

427
00:42:45,9 --> 00:42:54,33
food out of a bowl five cookbooks whole trend a wave of interest what was going on just food in a bowl.

428
00:42:54,43 --> 00:42:56,22
I don't get it but think about that.

429
00:42:56,43 --> 00:42:57,57
That's a lot of sensory design

430
00:42:57,57 --> 00:43:02,18
and it's with a bowl the more likely to hold the bowl in your hands of you hold the bowl you feel the way to feel the

431
00:43:02,18 --> 00:43:03,83
weight you're satisfied with the last

432
00:43:04,2 --> 00:43:11,27
or the whole food movement is around trying to eat healthier eat less in a way can control aware of your weight

433
00:43:11,27 --> 00:43:11,92
and controlling it.

434
00:43:12,14 --> 00:43:16,69
And so have you have a bowl in the hand helps that it's a warm bell maybe makes the world seem better.

435
00:43:18,04 --> 00:43:21,5
And that you can smell the contents more tricks to brenne different way.

436
00:43:21,9 --> 00:43:26,7
So there are trends that are out there already that people are engaged in that you can reframe in terms of this sort of

437
00:43:26,7 --> 00:43:31,5
sensory sensory design we didn't realize but you do realize you can measure it

438
00:43:31,5 --> 00:43:37,79
and what could be done through to I'm thinking a lot about a tour in Saudi Arabia

439
00:43:37,79 --> 00:43:41,34
and by the way that pediatricians talking about infant touch.

440
00:43:42,37 --> 00:43:48,34
So it's good for my wife's not here moment but she was premature by about three months.

441
00:43:49,96 --> 00:43:59,99
And actually popped out and so she's about this big..

442
00:43:53,4 --> 00:43:59,99
To have thought about here and I think that's because as a premature infant in the one hundred sixty S.

443
00:44:00,47 --> 00:44:07,59
You're stuck in an incubator and left you were touched. It turns out if your premise your baby a difficult birth.

444
00:44:07,9 --> 00:44:08,75
If you're touched.

445
00:44:08,96 --> 00:44:17,08
If you get this effect of touch message in his early months you will develop a healthier normal weight with less

446
00:44:17,42 --> 00:44:19,04
illness as a result.

447
00:44:19,37 --> 00:44:22,9
So I believe passionately early life touch is very important

448
00:44:23,24 --> 00:44:30,08
and it can be lost that a lot of parents will not touch their offspring both normal weight

449
00:44:30,08 --> 00:44:31,3
and the kind of pre-term ones

450
00:44:31,63 --> 00:44:38,03
and yet from all the studies I see you have a profoundly beneficial effect both on bonding both on quality of sleep on

451
00:44:38,03 --> 00:44:44,06
on all. Sort of health and disease prevention it all comes just to stimulating the touch.

452
00:44:44,39 --> 00:44:47,02
Maybe releasing some rumors well.

453
00:44:47,42 --> 00:44:50,48
And I'm going around the world trying to tell the pediatricians this is important

454
00:44:51,04 --> 00:44:57,41
and you should be at educating young mothers on the benefits of a personal touch. It's been neglected.

455
00:44:57,92 --> 00:45:03,13
And it's in all of our hands literally to to do something about it. However gentle.

456
00:45:05,98 --> 00:45:09,27
Because it will never be it always being.

457
00:45:13,49 --> 00:45:25,52
As you we were always has more than we used to so maybe it's more rebalancing

458
00:45:25,52 --> 00:45:30,04
and I think this is a reality where do we also get richer experience.

459
00:45:30,47 --> 00:45:34,79
I say a more different kind of different balance of sensory experience

460
00:45:35,34 --> 00:45:40,2
and in particular I want to say more connection with emotional side of our being.

461
00:45:40,9 --> 00:45:42,75
Of the world that is smell taste

462
00:45:42,75 --> 00:45:48,08
and touch these are the emotional senses with much more direct links to sort of mood and emotion.

463
00:45:48,67 --> 00:45:49,26
Than our hearing

464
00:45:49,26 --> 00:45:54,75
and vision have to go over to the back of the had then come so so it puts in touch with our motion side I think that's

465
00:45:54,75 --> 00:45:59,21
a good thing that's been neglected and I can point to these many examples you know from that from the infants to their.

466
00:46:00,92 --> 00:46:05,9
Old age pensioners to those in hospital who. Who.

467
00:46:05,93 --> 00:46:11,39
If you can engage in the emotional sciences more intelligently designed. Lead to benefits.

468
00:46:11,58 --> 00:46:13,91
Wherever you look you can pretend infants.

469
00:46:14,63 --> 00:46:15,63
Old people are wrinkly

470
00:46:15,63 --> 00:46:20,74
and then want to touch them through you know kids in hospital who are so petrified if you could patting dog

471
00:46:21,58 --> 00:46:23,25
and talking to the right.

472
00:46:23,39 --> 00:46:30,02
And yet that relaxation will come through touch with another object far outweighs the other things

473
00:46:30,02 --> 00:46:31,46
and does lead to improved.

474
00:46:32,05 --> 00:46:32,63
Recovery

475
00:46:32,97 --> 00:46:40,81
and I think across the across all the sciences you can see how being more aware of the impact of all of our senses

476
00:46:41,46 --> 00:46:48,67
being more aware of the sensory imbalance we can cause ourselves into largely as real technology can lead to a better

477
00:46:48,67 --> 00:47:02,62
more filled world as a result. So. Is it possible that in the future we will give more value.

478
00:47:05,97 --> 00:47:16,08
Senses for all experiences. Right now. For example in court with an eye witness is possible.

479
00:47:24,89 --> 00:47:35,39
So I think looking forward. Are. OK With the increased value put on the other senses. For sure.

480
00:47:35,95 --> 00:47:42,31
I am also kind of conscious in a way that it's almost no matter what I do no matter what the research shows.

481
00:47:43,09 --> 00:47:51,89
Nevertheless there is this kind of recurrent bias saw a belief that there will always bring it back to the visual in a

482
00:47:51,89 --> 00:47:59,99
way so I see it's a work in and fashion stalls and also situation.

483
00:48:00,01 --> 00:48:05,28
And where I can prove that adding the other senses makes the experience better.

484
00:48:06,15 --> 00:48:13,11
And yet I'm very aware that the consumer or person at home or that company will attribute that improvement to vision.

485
00:48:13,62 --> 00:48:16,07
Just take an action about the Euro football a moment.

486
00:48:16,33 --> 00:48:20,53
I know if I can give you the technology exists to give you a little plug into the side of your T.V.

487
00:48:20,78 --> 00:48:24,73
That were released the smell of fresh cut grass. So you can see them playing on the screen.

488
00:48:24,84 --> 00:48:26,33
You know the smell of fresh cut grass.

489
00:48:26,57 --> 00:48:31,3
I asked you homeless to learn the experience how to enjoy the game of football the ratings would go up.

490
00:48:32,94 --> 00:48:39,39
I believe with a cent. Unable to T.V. and Yet I think after watching the game.

491
00:48:39,42 --> 00:48:44,08
I could show you your results went up you liked it more but you say no I just it was just a good game.

492
00:48:44,49 --> 00:48:46,52
I can see it now and it was really good football.

493
00:48:47,29 --> 00:49:01,63
So always misattribute the causes of our experience to the wrong things and if. That's a challenge I think.

494
00:49:02,08 --> 00:49:05,26
And it's a rare. I guess up from five or ten years ago that I used to believe.

495
00:49:05,59 --> 00:49:09,74
Well if I can prove it then the world will change if I can show you the graph

496
00:49:09,74 --> 00:49:14,56
and say OK look is how much Europe peoples experience went up how much sales went up.

497
00:49:14,95 --> 00:49:20,75
You have to believe that you might say well is did you do your experiment well but once you believe me on that score.

498
00:49:21,25 --> 00:49:21,53
If it's significant.

499
00:49:21,83 --> 00:49:23,7
That's it time to change the way we're doing things

500
00:49:23,7 --> 00:49:27,65
and yet through experience I realize that's just not the way things happen often.

501
00:49:27,87 --> 00:49:36,44
There's a whole section of the world of people you might want to influence who no matter how no amount of evidence will

502
00:49:36,44 --> 00:49:40,22
graphs or data will ever convince those to how they can ensure it is beliefs

503
00:49:40,22 --> 00:49:45,02
and kind of go with that somehow so simply buying more experiments by writing more papers by showing more graphs will

504
00:49:45,02 --> 00:49:47,55
not do it. How else are going to influence them.

505
00:49:47,61 --> 00:49:54,36
And this is where I think for us this idea of kind of experiential events often working with chefs or

506
00:49:54,36 --> 00:49:58,7
or bringing people into environments where we can change lives and changes it and demonstrate them.

507
00:50:00,39 --> 00:50:03,46
That's much more powerful to many people and that does lead people to go away

508
00:50:03,46 --> 00:50:06,46
and say OK I'm going to do things differently where I am going to show the graph.

509
00:50:06,57 --> 00:50:07,52
I just know what I felt

510
00:50:08,00 --> 00:50:13,75
and we've had people coming out to do the three thousand person wine tasting where we change the lighting change the

511
00:50:13,75 --> 00:50:18,74
music use has one glass of wine in your hand a score card and see how fruity how much you like the wine

512
00:50:19,36 --> 00:50:23,52
and then you do what is called Card still got your glass of wine and I change the lighting.

513
00:50:23,9 --> 00:50:30,07
I change music and I ask you to taste the wine again and suddenly taste different and then change the lighting again.

514
00:50:30,99 --> 00:50:31,76
And you won't taste.

515
00:50:32,44 --> 00:50:37,31
I'm not doing was to one changing I'm making it more fruity fresh more like the less like some recreating the problems

516
00:50:37,31 --> 00:50:40,26
all rose a moment. In one environment ten minutes.

517
00:50:40,96 --> 00:50:44,23
And not everyone gets it but those who do said you know it's unbelievable.

518
00:50:44,28 --> 00:50:48,09
I think it's going to work and then as soon as you change the lighting change the taste. You know.

519
00:50:48,13 --> 00:50:54,14
And with that the power of your own experience. That's what will drive people to go out and say OK I'm going to do it.

520
00:50:54,24 --> 00:51:01,79
I took a long time to realize that that's made it a better way of maybe the only way bit of influencing people about

521
00:51:01,79 --> 00:51:04,24
things that that aren't necessarily into it is to them

522
00:51:04,24 --> 00:51:08,85
or go against the kind of the visual dominance that that is the bedrock

523
00:51:08,85 --> 00:51:13,47
and it is built into our brains so that this sounds like fun.

524
00:51:13,8 --> 00:51:28,69
Go on and make this period which changes even if you say why there isn't the why do you use during the. Yes.

525
00:51:29,11 --> 00:51:38,43
And I sort of fell instantaneously for some people but it's also fun. But now that's nowhere really makes a difference.

526
00:51:40,82 --> 00:52:02,07
Where. How. You know where they're understand what really in a way that. Now you know this is leaving.

527
00:52:03,07 --> 00:52:09,26
The European Union that will change the way it was raised a lot of things in Europe.

528
00:52:10,8 --> 00:52:24,39
People get scary you know what will happen next. Cortlandt. People don't know. So there is a difference.

529
00:52:24,61 --> 00:52:27,88
And I can imagine I would transform my eyesight.

530
00:52:30,45 --> 00:52:38,85
If that changes that the world around us will will change because we got our sensors our reprogrammed

531
00:52:39,32 --> 00:52:49,02
or get reprogrammed without us knowing both get reprogrammed how what will that do to the world if we have our sensors

532
00:52:49,02 --> 00:53:00,48
get bigger say in reality. So one might say of the maybe I could.

533
00:53:00,52 --> 00:53:07,24
I'll rephrase the question I get one who will tell you. Mario to. If we use our senses.

534
00:53:08,71 --> 00:53:20,77
So I won't change my thinking maybe you might say they bricks it voters they were describing on the television last

535
00:53:20,77 --> 00:53:25,45
night was a once in a lifetime of political commentators in the seventy's I've never seen anything like this

536
00:53:25,45 --> 00:53:30,9
and never will again no Will our children. So I think the events of the now that magnitude.

537
00:53:33,23 --> 00:53:42,64
And also the work that we do is more of nudging small little mind small change here a small change there are there are

538
00:53:42,64 --> 00:53:44,49
rarely full of your sick moments of wow.

539
00:53:45,16 --> 00:53:51,62
So it's more and a creation of lots of little small nudges benefits improvements

540
00:53:51,62 --> 00:53:56,66
and Huntsman's that over time say OK we really got somewhere now but at any one moment there's not suddenly.

541
00:53:57,26 --> 00:54:08,48
And a ha moment or a shock. And I want them to write what will change when you compare. Year two thousand the year two.

542
00:54:10,34 --> 00:54:19,4
So I write a lot about the foolishness of predicting what's going to happen a few years hence.

543
00:54:19,5 --> 00:54:22,85
Because someone has ever done. It's always got it wrong. So.

544
00:54:24,38 --> 00:54:31,43
That in one thousand nine hundred five eighty ninety four we had people I met scientists writing that a century.

545
00:54:31,46 --> 00:54:37,64
Hence So I mean one thousand nine hundred ninety four people beating pills they were eat meals that's ridiculous.

546
00:54:37,93 --> 00:54:43,35
Inefficient use of a pill that will come out of a slot in the wall that can only work.

547
00:54:43,49 --> 00:54:47,01
How much more productive would we be that's never happened. It's never going to happen.

548
00:54:47,16 --> 00:54:53,32
Going to be eating algal cuisine. Soylent Green that's not happening.

549
00:54:53,52 --> 00:55:02,42
And it goes on all the predictions about what the future will be like tonight not to be like that. So I have to say up.

550
00:55:02,66 --> 00:55:09,39
I no idea where it's going but if there is one person who could give me any open door to the future.

551
00:55:09,68 --> 00:55:14,61
You can open any door to the future. About this field.

552
00:55:14,64 --> 00:55:19,38
If you course because you know you will know more about those answers and I do

553
00:55:19,38 --> 00:55:33,68
and you will be yes I know it's a surprise for us all. That you know that's the whole idea of how you think that.

554
00:55:34,59 --> 00:55:38,28
You know really. The world will go the way it goes.

555
00:55:38,48 --> 00:55:48,08
And you know how you can exert some influence over trends and fashions. You can drive them or predict them I think not.

556
00:55:48,32 --> 00:55:59,71
So it was I got a very faint influence on. On forces that are much greater than yourself.

557
00:56:00,25 --> 00:56:06,7
In society at large and technology and the extent that it's foolish to.

558
00:56:07,24 --> 00:56:13,32
Even trying to predict will have this kind of overconfidence bias and gives us all a sense of certainty.

559
00:56:13,92 --> 00:56:25,11
There really isn't there have to think of this referendum for leaving you or you that our senses were dominant.

560
00:56:29,07 --> 00:56:31,53
That's the extent that we are primarily audiovisual creatures.

561
00:56:32,71 --> 00:56:43,2
The senses are the more rational ones that any rebalancing of our senses and ramping up of smell of taste of touch.

562
00:56:43,35 --> 00:56:48,06
These are the more emotional senses. They might imagine that would lead to more emotional decision making.

563
00:56:49,46 --> 00:56:53,73
You take from that what you will. Whether that would have meant would have left. Or later.

564
00:56:54,15 --> 00:57:12,74
Who knows one of the other Sure. So. What is your reaction for us. Regarding your research on census which is.

565
00:57:14,73 --> 00:57:24,89
I don't want to miss anything. What is for you the most important thing regarding.

566
00:57:26,1 --> 00:57:31,72
The Census what is what is your your main quest or your main goal.

567
00:57:32,1 --> 00:57:41,68
In studying them is that the main goal for myself and for the lab I run here at Oxford is to try and understand

568
00:57:41,68 --> 00:57:47,08
and take the understanding of how the senses interact. The sometimes unpredictable ways.

569
00:57:48,00 --> 00:57:55,79
Our senses combine information and use those rules in the design of a different and hopefully better world

570
00:57:55,79 --> 00:58:01,28
and that those kind of insights about the science of the senses about. The sensory perception.

571
00:58:01,74 --> 00:58:08,13
I think spanned everywhere from the design of warning signals to car drivers through the design of food

572
00:58:08,13 --> 00:58:13,05
and beverage experiences that are more stimulating or healthier omo memorable people have different of goals

573
00:58:13,05 --> 00:58:17,39
or objectives through to the environments in which we live and work.

574
00:58:18,65 --> 00:58:23,89
With a lot to work on kind of the ambient fragrance and paint colors and lighting and nature

575
00:58:23,89 --> 00:58:27,76
and how those things might make us healthier happier more productive.

576
00:58:29,33 --> 00:58:39,29
Through all sorts of ways of health care is an area that hasn't as yet received as much research around sensory design

577
00:58:39,29 --> 00:58:43,88
multisensory design and you throw a few things which we better.

578
00:58:44,95 --> 00:58:55,56
Generally for people in your safety and you know that it uses a lot of you.

579
00:58:58,53 --> 00:59:07,01
So something like bringing hospitality back to hospitals that would be one thing that lead to a better world.

580
00:59:07,43 --> 00:59:11,8
And that all will get there through engaging the senses in a more intelligent design.

581
00:59:12,64 --> 00:59:16,26
Hospital health care type situations.

582
00:59:17,01 --> 00:59:25,18
I think in the delivery of sort of healthier foods that taste the same as they always did to us.

583
00:59:25,21 --> 00:59:26,35
That's important to many people

584
00:59:26,6 --> 00:59:32,08
and yet have less of than healthy ingredients through through through intelligent design of the multi sensory

585
00:59:32,08 --> 00:59:40,14
experience through everything we know about how the mind processes flavor that's going to be HUGE through sort of

586
00:59:40,14 --> 00:59:49,93
because of transport technology. A lot of benefits for driver safety for air traffic control.

587
00:59:50,57 --> 00:59:59,99
Fall in financial trading situations where every kind of milliseconds counts in terms of a lot of sex in a car has a.

588
01:00:00,73 --> 01:00:09,05
So it's actually now. So the present time drivers are being confronted with more and more information.

589
01:00:10,08 --> 01:00:15,85
Mobile phone and internet in their cars head up displays that are telling you about every single hotel

590
01:00:15,85 --> 01:00:20,25
and bar restaurant. Competing with what's going to be going on outside the window screen.

591
01:00:20,62 --> 01:00:23,2
There's a lot more distractions in cars and ever before.

592
01:00:23,58 --> 01:00:30,29
Unable to technology all of those distractions are now being delivered by the content providers not the car companies.

593
01:00:31,32 --> 01:00:35,37
So can we have a technology for years but the car companies were never really set for fear of accident.

594
01:00:36,1 --> 01:00:41,19
But now it's the mobile providers for the first time can actually provide content drivers

595
01:00:41,35 --> 01:00:44,77
and they don't care about safety not in the same way as the car companies do.

596
01:00:45,22 --> 01:00:49,72
Well that means that if suddenly we have a generation of drivers who are more distracted or more texting.

597
01:00:50,48 --> 01:00:52,2
Or the most dangerous thing you could possibly do.

598
01:00:53,59 --> 01:00:59,51
And I tell my undergraduates you know for the females in the audience the most likely way they're going to die is at

599
01:00:59,51 --> 01:01:01,43
the Huns of the wheel

600
01:01:01,72 --> 01:01:08,66
when their boyfriends driving by far the biggest cause of death is through this texting distraction of the wheel

601
01:01:09,58 --> 01:01:11,66
and so anything we can do that have a profound influence

602
01:01:11,8 --> 01:01:17,42
and I see from our research that we can deliver we can get drivers to turn their heads back to the road if they're

603
01:01:17,42 --> 01:01:20,1
distracted. To brake more rapidly.

604
01:01:20,19 --> 01:01:25,57
If potential collision the event is occurring through not driving a red throbbing like that.

605
01:01:25,59 --> 01:01:26,32
The engineer designs

606
01:01:26,32 --> 01:01:32,3
but by putting science behind your head so it turns out that your brain has special dedicated circuits just this space

607
01:01:32,3 --> 01:01:35,39
behind your head. The engineer never thought of putting a warning signal there.

608
01:01:35,42 --> 01:01:41,45
But if I know from I'm saying how the brain works over the brain works that the special bit of the brain only has about

609
01:01:41,45 --> 01:01:44,97
this for the space that isn't used while driving. If I put something in your head rest.

610
01:01:45,15 --> 01:01:47,85
You can make you turn your head that much faster than anything else.

611
01:01:48,12 --> 01:01:56,95
We go there for sound comes from a sound come from just behind your head your brain treats it differently processes it

612
01:01:56,95 --> 01:01:59,41
differently and takes up to the same sound comes from in front.

613
01:02:00,37 --> 01:02:01,28
From the dashboard

614
01:02:01,55 --> 01:02:07,76
or from the door panel same sound same loud speaker that just behind your idea is processed differently now.

615
01:02:07,87 --> 01:02:08,27
And for that.

616
01:02:08,38 --> 01:02:13,82
No engineer in the in the car can restore that little voice out of the brain does our present understanding that the

617
01:02:13,82 --> 01:02:17,62
senses and how they process information is one of the unexpected things that comes out

618
01:02:17,62 --> 01:02:19,96
and you know we've demonstrated in the lab

619
01:02:19,96 --> 01:02:28,01
but also the driving simulator that you can reduce reaction times amongst drivers to extent that should lead to

620
01:02:28,01 --> 01:02:31,68
significant reductions in. And accidents on the roads.

621
01:02:32,44 --> 01:02:47,02
For example where people drove to get a car which you're going to prevent a thing before you bus that's your action

622
01:02:47,02 --> 01:02:58,94
kind of if you don't do that car. I wouldn't really say yeah but I believe so. Breath.

623
01:02:59,51 --> 01:03:05,98
There is I mean you can detect if people are sleepy so probably that exact figures

624
01:03:05,98 --> 01:03:10,8
but it might turn out that sleepy dot drivers are more dangerous as a group than drunk drivers

625
01:03:10,8 --> 01:03:16,11
and maybe a third of all accidents are and some are related to sleepiness for example we'll tartness.

626
01:03:16,2 --> 01:03:21,01
And say that is in fact a big cause of death on our roads.

627
01:03:21,24 --> 01:03:25,41
I now radio the car companies can detect signs of falling asleep.

628
01:03:26,37 --> 01:03:31,34
You're calm ask your question and then depending on how you are response you can tell from the gaps.

629
01:03:31,53 --> 01:03:36,47
You can measure your blinking. You can measure how tightly your You're squeezing the steering wheel.

630
01:03:36,68 --> 01:03:40,03
You can measure how aggressively you're braking and trim

631
01:03:40,03 --> 01:03:47,4
or those cues can get a pretty good an estimate of your sleepiness. So I imagine the same is true for.

632
01:03:48,37 --> 01:03:58,59
Four four I'll call low. There with. The sleepiness one definitely.

633
01:04:03,56 --> 01:04:12,25
So the I know that the car companies have been working on the technologies to predict the sleepiness of drivers.

634
01:04:12,83 --> 01:04:21,84
And then take countermeasures which probably if your car switches itself off you think you're tired now is going to buy

635
01:04:21,84 --> 01:04:28,62
that car. But if it be automatically lowers the windows or releases an alerting scent.

636
01:04:29,08 --> 01:04:30,76
That's not quite such an aggressive move.

637
01:04:31,55 --> 01:04:36,12
Ideally should stop but maybe that's kind of into media companies are thinking in that space

638
01:04:36,18 --> 01:04:41,69
and have the technology to work. In terms of the drinking while driving. I haven't heard actually anything.

639
01:04:42,21 --> 01:04:49,21
In that space and your example of an angel were going to say well maybe they work.

640
01:04:49,3 --> 01:04:53,32
That's a strange jump from from from car drivers to financial markets

641
01:04:53,32 --> 01:04:59,25
but it was in a way they're the same in that this research on the design of warning signals.

642
01:04:59,81 --> 01:05:05,46
Is an area where every millisecond every thousandth of a second matters. There are many other situations in life.

643
01:05:05,6 --> 01:05:08,45
I mean I say I can save you one hundred a second.

644
01:05:08,54 --> 01:05:13,71
So what who cares what I do to life driving and financial markets

645
01:05:13,71 --> 01:05:23,49
or two of the few areas where such tiny improvements influence can lead to huge financial consequences be it in health

646
01:05:23,49 --> 01:05:31,91
care provision for death at the wheel or gears and profits made in turbulent financial markets like for the last day

647
01:05:31,91 --> 01:05:32,23
or two.

648
01:05:32,33 --> 01:05:41,49
So they need something like the figures from Information Week one of the magazines for every millisecond advantage.

649
01:05:41,97 --> 01:05:52,05
A typical sized trading house gets in the spin which information comes in that's one hundred million dollars a year to

650
01:05:52,05 --> 01:05:59,25
that company. So you're already see that the. Lot of these companies will put their offices as close to.

651
01:06:00,01 --> 01:06:05,99
Well the cables come out from under the North Atlantic to get that little millisecond advantage as compared to the

652
01:06:05,99 --> 01:06:11,21
competitors who are in the city. So they're physically doing things to maximize speed up.

653
01:06:11,48 --> 01:06:17,42
But they've never as far as I can tell ever thought about the design of that interface screens the alerts that they get.

654
01:06:18,25 --> 01:06:20,49
So you know it has just happened.

655
01:06:20,89 --> 01:06:25,35
You need some sort of special sound that maybe that would give you a few milliseconds advantage.

656
01:06:25,55 --> 01:06:29,98
And if you if you're an economist then you can you say well. To the global economy.

657
01:06:30,36 --> 01:06:36,24
What would the benefit of one millisecond faster braking be in terms of accidents

658
01:06:36,61 --> 01:06:41,63
and more the latter you can say to the financial markets what would the benefit of one millisecond be to a lot of money

659
01:06:41,63 --> 01:06:47,06
made by companies that they can actually equate say maybe they're worth as much or maybe the financial markets.

660
01:06:47,26 --> 01:06:48,41
That's a bigger.

661
01:06:49,15 --> 01:06:53,9
Potential market for milliseconds mattering and I mean because financial

662
01:06:54,75 --> 01:07:01,58
and result there's a lot of my work is is taking domains that are very different the so you can apply the insights here

663
01:07:01,8 --> 01:07:06,58
and there's thirty years of research on warning signals for car drivers and as far as I can tell there's nothing.

664
01:07:07,31 --> 01:07:16,13
On trading one traders. Nothing. That's always the so much knowledge here and does it's the same thing.

665
01:07:16,95 --> 01:07:21,57
But we have different different plans and that's a lot of our research is just taking insights from one area

666
01:07:22,18 --> 01:07:27,56
and saying hey can we apply them over there who are tied to a particular industry or product or category.

667
01:07:28,3 --> 01:07:35,18
And in fact there's lots of knowledge that just is sort of siloed. And what about. When.

668
01:07:38,99 --> 01:07:52,74
You say well if you are able to read people by using your sense. So there is no suppose about it as a fact you can.

669
01:07:53,67 --> 01:08:02,76
Help reduce modulator pain through the senses. And there are a number of ways. Doing it has been proven to effectively.

670
01:08:08,3 --> 01:08:10,14
What you're what your partner.

671
01:08:11,55 --> 01:08:18,84
So we've done a very small part of the research looking at how we can take insights about how the sensor interaction

672
01:08:18,84 --> 01:08:24,43
from one domain to another. So for example from every move learned about sensory dominance in food.

673
01:08:24,8 --> 01:08:26,35
How can we apply that to our sensory dollars

674
01:08:26,35 --> 01:08:35,46
and pain relief from pleasure pain such as twenty of the same continuum maybe what we've been doing is for example.

675
01:08:37,11 --> 01:08:41,96
We know that you perceive things more intensely if you concentrate on them. And if you're distracted.

676
01:08:42,2 --> 01:08:51,33
You don't notice them as much. So a lot of pain relief strategies say for bandage changes very painful procedure.

677
01:08:51,54 --> 01:08:56,3
What can you do to distract people take their attention away somewhere else it will hurt less.

678
01:08:57,58 --> 01:09:01,69
So it doesn't work on attentional manipulation.

679
01:09:01,94 --> 01:09:10,18
So maybe if you watch a very engaging video visual distraction painters less that's a factor.

680
01:09:10,22 --> 01:09:12,87
That's going to incorporate it in some areas

681
01:09:12,87 --> 01:09:19,17
but we've also been looking at his patients here in Oxford working with an Australian colleague we're looking at a

682
01:09:19,17 --> 01:09:25,76
special group of chronic Regional Pain Syndrome say R.P.S. Patients and these are rare.

683
01:09:25,84 --> 01:09:33,3
Fortunately very severe cases of birth people who've been on the motorbike or thrown off in a car accident.

684
01:09:34,01 --> 01:09:38,27
Broke something seems to recovered. And then six months later.

685
01:09:38,37 --> 01:09:46,51
Suddenly they get it's excruciating pain that will not go away that medication has no impact on the surgery seems to

686
01:09:46,51 --> 01:09:50,41
have no impact on where you're left with a lifelong chronic pain and all them.

687
01:09:51,39 --> 01:09:56,94
So we've been doing work with these patients who are very hard to work with if they're in such pain they don't are

688
01:09:56,94 --> 01:09:59,78
taking part in when your experiment is the last thing.

689
01:10:00,56 --> 01:10:01,36
I think they want to do

690
01:10:02,00 --> 01:10:07,57
but those who've been able to work with you know show that if I can make your hand look smaller I can use visual

691
01:10:07,57 --> 01:10:09,97
dominance. So we have Asians looking at that.

692
01:10:11,64 --> 01:10:17,41
That affected limb through a pair of binoculars or been turned backwards so they look smaller

693
01:10:17,77 --> 01:10:24,34
and if you look at your limit look smaller to you. Really. And it also reduces swelling.

694
01:10:25,1 --> 01:10:31,14
So this psychological trip of just using visual dollars of the eyes has by the psychological impact on reduced pain

695
01:10:31,33 --> 01:10:38,94
but also a physiological impact on reduced swelling in the limb. How long this lasts.

696
01:10:39,23 --> 01:10:44,22
I can't say I demonstrated we do it in an hour for twenty or fifty or one hundred of these patients.

697
01:10:44,65 --> 01:10:50,12
If you catch your limb and it was very small for a week a month a year. Who knows how long the effects will last.

698
01:10:50,2 --> 01:10:52,15
Will they wear off. It's possible we don't know.

699
01:10:52,31 --> 01:10:58,32
But it's going to very difficult very long term at least in the short term we can deliver pain relief through these

700
01:10:58,32 --> 01:11:05,47
sort of tricks of the mind so lower my colleagues who are thinking about. Fragrance I know that for babies.

701
01:11:05,89 --> 01:11:10,54
When they have some ask what's called a heel preposterous procedure very painful.

702
01:11:10,56 --> 01:11:14,6
What the nurses do they give the baby a sugar cube.

703
01:11:15,12 --> 01:11:20,63
So sweet taste reduces and they get across Mobile In fact my colleagues in Australia.

704
01:11:21,23 --> 01:11:25,41
Have been working in adults to see whether a sweet smell can do the same thing.

705
01:11:25,5 --> 01:11:28,99
So if I ask you is strawberries caramel has been allowed a sweet.

706
01:11:29,38 --> 01:11:35,58
You say Yes I smell sweet because literally smells weeks once a taste and smell the smell

707
01:11:35,58 --> 01:11:44,15
and yet you can smell sweet and if you diffuse that aroma while people are in pain they will rate the pain lower

708
01:11:44,15 --> 01:11:46,29
and they'll be able to resist for longer

709
01:11:46,29 --> 01:11:54,00
and they get using the senses using sight in one case using smell in another and I'm equally convinced in.

710
01:11:54,4 --> 01:11:58,6
The effect of sound. You know you go to the dentist.

711
01:12:01,08 --> 01:12:03,9
I'm sure if I could take that sound out to be a wholly different experience.

712
01:12:03,92 --> 01:12:10,23
I could quieten it if I could play the sound of chipping birds something else. It just would last.

713
01:12:10,39 --> 01:12:31,77
So all the senses play a role. So what are the things. Around you. That must be solvable or. You may get. Your ears.

714
01:12:32,97 --> 01:12:36,43
Which you saw here

715
01:12:36,43 --> 01:12:51,21
and you know these all you maybe something so it's up to sort of there are there are lots of questions that someone

716
01:12:51,21 --> 01:12:57,29
like myself can answer as a lot of unsolvable things that I'm not the right kind of specialist for.

717
01:12:58,28 --> 01:13:07,97
Those fortune I think we have insights that could be useful then almost any situation of daily life is the potential

718
01:13:07,97 --> 01:13:09,99
benefits of better sensory design

719
01:13:09,99 --> 01:13:15,8
and that is you know from hospitals to health care to offices to the home to the workplace to the airplane.

720
01:13:16,02 --> 01:13:23,05
To the car to transport wherever you look I think engaging the senses all of the senses better would lead to more

721
01:13:23,05 --> 01:13:27,77
immersive more engaging healthier more enjoyable more memorable experiences. So which the ones we haven't got yet.

722
01:13:27,82 --> 01:13:32,69
They tend to be the ones where it's going to be hard to do hard to get to.

723
01:13:32,87 --> 01:13:37,92
Our hard to convince those in authority that this is something they might think about.

724
01:13:39,62 --> 01:13:45,88
So all of those hospitals is one that I think so.

725
01:13:45,92 --> 01:13:51,18
Huge potential market loss and insights that we take from designing supermarkets

726
01:13:51,18 --> 01:13:57,19
and stalls to be better a lot of the insights and you can apply to the health care situation. We haven't got there yet.

727
01:13:57,4 --> 01:13:59,39
Because all of our grant applications been turned down.

728
01:14:00,65 --> 01:14:08,73
Finally we've got a Spanish hospital just outside Barcelona that treat a private hospital that treats children with

729
01:14:08,73 --> 01:14:14,23
cancer and they were very open minded approach to engaging with a sense and I did some brilliant things

730
01:14:14,71 --> 01:14:20,83
and we have start working with them since this year together with the colony center to design sensory design not

731
01:14:20,83 --> 01:14:23,46
sensory design of health care for some very sick children.

732
01:14:23,69 --> 01:14:26,62
There are also things I think we can apply there some are thinking in five

733
01:14:26,62 --> 01:14:29,91
or ten years that will come to be much more relevant.

734
01:14:30,77 --> 01:14:36,98
Airplanes is another one of the mentioned some of the sound bite this music that will have the taste of the food

735
01:14:37,31 --> 01:14:39,15
but I think there's a lot more that can be done there.

736
01:14:39,4 --> 01:14:46,89
It's just hard to get access to do the experiments on the airplanes. But I see some of the some of the big line.

737
01:14:48,5 --> 01:14:53,13
You know they want to innovate to differentiate themselves at least at the top end in the first and business class

738
01:14:53,65 --> 01:14:59,48
and yet you think I am the more celebrity chefs can they get them to realize that celebrities have doesn't make the

739
01:14:59,48 --> 01:15:01,65
food taste better. That's not the way to go.

740
01:15:02,13 --> 01:15:07,04
So you got you've got the intention but not the execution and I think engaging all the senses

741
01:15:07,04 --> 01:15:11,86
and think about the whole experience of the problems all rosé And how do you put that into the airplane might offer

742
01:15:11,86 --> 01:15:18,27
the potential to radically innovate in that space to. There's money there's interest but they are together.

743
01:15:20,4 --> 01:15:23,55
And the trading floor. Is another one that's.

744
01:15:25,9 --> 01:15:32,55
Has its own peculiar difficulties in that the financial traders are masters of the universe. They think their god.

745
01:15:35,47 --> 01:15:37,66
And their every every hour of that time is worth.

746
01:15:38,72 --> 01:15:39,97
How many million euros

747
01:15:39,97 --> 01:15:45,27
or pounds whatever it is so I want to test them I want to take part in the experiment so I can demonstrate to them the

748
01:15:45,27 --> 01:15:51,16
benefit of using this tool that. That important to give up their time to take part in research.

749
01:15:51,79 --> 01:15:55,78
Does the other person reason is it is quite impossible to get to maybe know what.

750
01:15:55,8 --> 01:15:59,58
There are ways around it but there are also some challenging mames.

751
01:16:00,31 --> 01:16:07,36
Because of the use in control of them or because of the practical limitations. I hope you will get there somehow.

752
01:16:07,98 --> 01:16:13,8
So the challenge really for us is to say how do we how do we influence though that those who are controlled to take

753
01:16:13,8 --> 01:16:36,91
that step. So we know very well we don't.

754
01:16:39,1 --> 01:16:47,88
So I guess there's a potential that if we don't use we don't use it you lose it is kind of the phrase that gets bandied

755
01:16:47,88 --> 01:16:48,75
around a lot

756
01:16:49,37 --> 01:16:55,67
and one might think of something like our pheromone all senses kind of into concepts of ik chemical communication that

757
01:16:55,67 --> 01:17:02,37
we know dogs have another animals have but humans seem to more or less have lost sight we didn't need it.

758
01:17:02,87 --> 01:17:05,75
And maybe that is our suggestion is that when we went from four legs

759
01:17:05,89 --> 01:17:08,43
and our noses very close to the ground the smell was very important

760
01:17:08,88 --> 01:17:13,58
and then we went up into two legs suddenly we're much further away from the smelly stuff.

761
01:17:14,26 --> 01:17:17,82
And hence that's partly whence our sense of smell started its decline.

762
01:17:18,8 --> 01:17:23,12
And that now if we compare ourselves to dogs and clearly dogs are much better able to navigate

763
01:17:23,12 --> 01:17:26,67
and to tell apart things through smell. Whereas our sense of smell.

764
01:17:27,11 --> 01:17:29,68
We can see in the evolutionary record that it was very important.

765
01:17:30,07 --> 01:17:34,85
It's more of a genetic material it's given over to smell than to any other sense. And yet today.

766
01:17:35,03 --> 01:17:42,00
Look at U R I N R R R R nasal operator says is sadly diminished. From what it once was in the past so losing it.

767
01:17:42,14 --> 01:17:50,00
You could say you know there are problems. If you would like to read the extinction of the species isn't it.

768
01:17:50,00 --> 01:17:52,35
Is it a problem that little furry rats somewhere

769
01:17:52,35 --> 01:17:55,79
and I mean they're off to five hours of New Zealand just could extinguished.

770
01:17:55,94 --> 01:18:01,64
They also be a problem there are cuts after. Much. If we lost our senses.

771
01:18:02,35 --> 01:18:08,49
I mean there's a question you can ask people if I have had to take one of your senses away which one would you least

772
01:18:08,84 --> 01:18:13,12
like to lose and never goes of course my my eyes.

773
01:18:15,87 --> 01:18:22,51
But in fact if you look at suicides after the loss of a sense that people are far more likely to commit suicide after

774
01:18:22,51 --> 01:18:24,64
the loss of smell than vision.

775
01:18:26,11 --> 01:18:30,44
This is the one that gives you your emotional life your connection your enjoyment of food.

776
01:18:31,06 --> 01:18:37,06
Linked to sort of attraction and so does that this is the one that actually leads to you should avoid a lot of.

777
01:18:38,54 --> 01:18:39,81
That maybe those who are blind

778
01:18:39,81 --> 01:18:44,24
and still have that still have the memories of images they can create for a number of years after.

779
01:18:45,01 --> 01:18:47,92
Taste it turns out is probably the least important one.

780
01:18:47,95 --> 01:18:50,39
You could get rid of that maybe you would not realize

781
01:18:50,95 --> 01:18:56,82
and I have been a few scientists in history who lost their tongues to syphilis

782
01:18:57,45 --> 01:19:00,31
and the French army were quite fond of chopping out.

783
01:19:00,74 --> 01:19:08,76
Algerian tongues and Napoleonic wars or whatever it was and in both cases it seems. Nothing much changes.

784
01:19:09,21 --> 01:19:11,23
So actually taste your time might be very important.

785
01:19:11,54 --> 01:19:20,29
All I know is if I were in danger of losing them I guess it'll be a very slow decline. And I think really probably.

786
01:19:20,61 --> 01:19:24,14
We still do use all of our senses some of the time.

787
01:19:24,27 --> 01:19:32,07
So it's not that we never use smell like if you don't rank awful smelling fish you will use it then you will use it for

788
01:19:32,07 --> 01:19:32,97
detecting fire.

789
01:19:33,18 --> 01:19:39,25
So they all are still used and we're trying to just increase the amount of time that people are

790
01:19:39,25 --> 01:19:46,31
and connect in touch with or thinking about all mindful of their other senses. But.

791
01:19:47,03 --> 01:20:00,37
What I was really really depends which one we lose big with this role for emergency room. So we do. That.

792
01:20:00,88 --> 01:20:05,45
We have lost it depends which scientist you listen to when you mostly lost it.

793
01:20:06,85 --> 01:20:14,07
Then when I whether we have lost it really no I actually I look at dogs and say I can see that they get all horny when.

794
01:20:14,8 --> 01:20:18,15
This sort of smell comes along but I don't feel like I'm missing anything by.

795
01:20:18,85 --> 01:20:25,44
Now in that sense I guess people by the very fact that you say which sense would you least like to lose

796
01:20:25,44 --> 01:20:29,75
and nobody really says smell implies that we don't evaluate as much as perhaps we should.

797
01:20:33,42 --> 01:20:37,04
Loss of the sense of touch is pretty pretty debilitating.

798
01:20:38,14 --> 01:20:45,54
So he's going to tell you which we should we don't know if you know this. Like it or.

799
01:20:49,98 --> 01:21:04,21
Don't we need every parent not let me get on OK. There is. So. So you know maybe. What happens is.

800
01:21:06,89 --> 01:21:15,22
Maybe we evolve with different individual senses telling us about different part of the world all of our stuff we need

801
01:21:15,22 --> 01:21:18,49
to know about poisons and pleasures food. And mates.

802
01:21:19,55 --> 01:21:25,29
And then our brain with all this information starts to combine the senses and we have multi sensory perception

803
01:21:25,79 --> 01:21:29,29
and then that allows you to almost sort of predict or do things differently.

804
01:21:31,36 --> 01:21:40,54
In a way so I guess we humans are quite rare in not only tasting food also smelling it as

805
01:21:40,54 --> 01:21:43,15
when we swallow act it is pushed into the back of our nose.

806
01:21:43,76 --> 01:21:48,98
So it seems like we have a pretty unique way of tasting food that involves a nose.

807
01:21:50,1 --> 01:21:53,26
As well as a mouth and not many other species all of the species have that.

808
01:21:53,93 --> 01:21:59,99
So it kind of adapted or learn new ways of doing things through combining sensors and.

809
01:22:00,01 --> 01:22:06,97
What ways or using sense was developed for one thing for something else and that maybe now without.

810
01:22:07,97 --> 01:22:12,09
If I look at the the animal kingdom that maybe makes selection is mostly about smell

811
01:22:12,09 --> 01:22:15,74
and pheromones doesn't really matter. You know how shiny that.

812
01:22:16,73 --> 01:22:22,98
And the talk or something else or hot it's all about smell. And humans it seems.

813
01:22:22,98 --> 01:22:29,68
Otherwise it's a pre-primary about the visual. So maybe we change our dominance.

814
01:22:30,01 --> 01:22:36,82
When I would visually driven creatures. Maybe men more and more than women who were doing things a different way.

815
01:22:37,03 --> 01:22:46,46
Maybe we'll do something that maybe I'm not as able by visually inspecting a potential mate to figure out whether

816
01:22:46,46 --> 01:22:52,69
they'll make a good sort of genetic match in terms of the immune response of the offspring smell would tell that much

817
01:22:52,69 --> 01:22:57,01
more directly seven to smell. I still might become eight and reproduction will still take place.

818
01:22:57,3 --> 01:23:07,9
That maybe there was some errors or problems that will will ensue you use your depth as a research.

819
01:23:09,00 --> 01:23:12,25
Because words are visually dominant so love is so is the thing again of we.

820
01:23:12,91 --> 01:23:20,76
We miss attributes or we will develop this bigger visual brain Talbot's to find fruit in the trees

821
01:23:20,76 --> 01:23:25,54
and then once half of our brain is given over to vision. It's hard not to use it for the other things.

822
01:23:26,53 --> 01:23:37,42
So if we go on dating. Yeah it's better to do that. So that's the thing that I think we better genes all your senses.

823
01:23:37,69 --> 01:23:38,39
The more sense.

824
01:23:38,4 --> 01:23:42,06
You have the more information you've got and essentially about sight different stuff

825
01:23:42,06 --> 01:23:50,78
and yet we have been working with artists like Clara city who have been doing some playing in this space thinking about

826
01:23:50,78 --> 01:23:56,46
the smell dating agency. So she and others are our famous for getting a hundred people to wear a T.

827
01:23:56,46 --> 01:24:04,19
Shirt don't wash for a day or two and bring your teacher. And then that the speed data is just smile all the T.

828
01:24:04,19 --> 01:24:08,45
Shirts from one to one hundred. It's all I'd like to take that one and that one and that one.

829
01:24:09,05 --> 01:24:16,19
And then you get to meet the one and sometimes it's somebody about a sex that you're not a very small one

830
01:24:16,19 --> 01:24:22,37
but it's actually a man or vice versa and a bit of a shock and other times and they smell great but they look awful.

831
01:24:22,69 --> 01:24:25,15
So when you do I guess you'll end up reverting to your eyes

832
01:24:25,75 --> 01:24:30,09
and yet I still wonder if you were given both not just the kind of the online visual profile

833
01:24:30,09 --> 01:24:39,71
but also the smile with those two cues. Maybe come to a better choice. And it is going to get worse. What works.

834
01:24:43,00 --> 01:24:49,22
Where you are you three will smell the most smell different your teachers will smell different

835
01:24:49,49 --> 01:24:54,04
and they'll be more attractive to some people than others. So there is information there.

836
01:24:54,4 --> 01:24:58,53
We don't all smell or same and somebody will have attraction to one does it work.

837
01:24:58,89 --> 01:25:03,89
What would be a long term consequence if we had you know did the experiment one hundred people you can only pick your

838
01:25:03,89 --> 01:25:04,83
mate from a picture

839
01:25:05,23 --> 01:25:11,04
and another hundred you can only pick from Smell who would wish which group with the divorce rates be higher.

840
01:25:11,82 --> 01:25:12,82
That's going to experiment that.

841
01:25:13,4 --> 01:25:18,67
Probably will get their fix to do better and so you won't you know I'm not sure actually.

842
01:25:23,64 --> 01:25:27,27
I definitely think that if you have the smell and the vision you do better than just a vision.

843
01:25:28,74 --> 01:25:38,77
If you had one or the other cures that are these that have ethics you see

844
01:25:38,77 --> 01:25:44,8
and then they would let me hear there is an artistic expression expects perience. Art Project you can do it.

845
01:25:45,63 --> 01:25:47,58
But if your measurement scientists then go to the Ethics

846
01:25:47,58 --> 01:25:51,31
and then people start wondering about the ethics of that sort of.

847
01:25:52,03 --> 01:25:59,89
But it is interesting and it is sort of open it's more. To make you think differently and maybe there are some.

848
01:26:00,26 --> 01:26:09,59
Differences between males and females so about. Feelings. Using your senses.

849
01:26:10,35 --> 01:26:16,6
Is possible when you reprogram your senses or your senses a different way.

850
01:26:18,14 --> 01:26:26,22
That you experience of feelings like love or heal or jealousy or anger.

851
01:26:32,37 --> 01:26:39,02
I don't know where you want to put feelings and emotions that they're not exclusively tied to a particular sense.

852
01:26:39,9 --> 01:26:44,16
So I think I could show you a range of faces

853
01:26:44,64 --> 01:26:48,19
and you say that one looks happy that one looks sad that one looks guilty that

854
01:26:48,19 --> 01:26:53,98
when I was depressed I could I could play you some of the sounds of people's voices you could do the same thing I could

855
01:26:53,98 --> 01:26:55,64
even put your hand out.

856
01:26:56,18 --> 01:27:01,33
And I can pretty tap and stroke and you were able to be able to decode the emotion through touch

857
01:27:02,67 --> 01:27:06,9
and even through smell you can someday react and smell happy from fearful.

858
01:27:07,74 --> 01:27:15,34
So the same things are so if the sense is it possible is it possible that you have an army.

859
01:27:16,81 --> 01:27:28,43
You will find you have already let you use there but your smell. Anything else to build up a feeling of hate.

860
01:27:30,17 --> 01:27:38,55
For example. Is a possible. Does it does it does it's no different here in Britain.

861
01:27:39,81 --> 01:27:44,01
Don't want to be part of yeah but today better.

862
01:27:45,76 --> 01:27:52,45
So it's certainly true that the ambience that can change our mood make it more relaxed more aggressive.

863
01:27:54,86 --> 01:28:03,11
Make us more alert or more relaxed. They might say I want my fighting force to be. Sort of alerts not relaxed.

864
01:28:03,91 --> 01:28:09,97
So maybe you're thinking a certain kind of. Citrus open it's really better than lavender or camel mile.

865
01:28:14,33 --> 01:28:39,55
And beyond that. For example if a police. Just played. You go you. Know. Is it possible that you will go. Yes. Really.

866
01:28:40,57 --> 01:28:44,99
So if possible so we say. Maybe so there are studies out there.

867
01:28:47,11 --> 01:28:53,44
That you can change the scent in the slot machines and Last Vegas

868
01:28:53,83 --> 01:28:55,92
and there are certain sense of make people spend more.

869
01:28:58,32 --> 01:29:01,48
People's ears away tell you what the scent is exactly but they say it works a special sound.

870
01:29:02,45 --> 01:29:06,7
If you believe that there are all sorts of act comes you could get their sense all

871
01:29:06,7 --> 01:29:12,03
and increase the likelihood of a negotiation coming to a successful conclusion there a sense that could be worked on

872
01:29:12,03 --> 01:29:20,62
the trainer trading floor to say. Even so frame it as is there a sense that will get people to spend more.

873
01:29:20,7 --> 01:29:24,75
Is there a sense that will get people to be more aggressive Is there a site that will make people fight better or

874
01:29:24,75 --> 01:29:30,45
or can fast sooner. You might get I think you could get any of those outcomes through scent.

875
01:29:30,68 --> 01:29:32,93
They're really going the mechanism is well if you're more lax.

876
01:29:33,64 --> 01:29:37,06
I can tell you all sorts of stuff where it's not time intensive I want

877
01:29:37,06 --> 01:29:43,99
and the mechanism that smile makes you confess sooner is by making you react perhaps. There.

878
01:29:44,01 --> 01:29:47,07
The reason why sent makes you spend more is not directed at you spend more.

879
01:29:47,16 --> 01:29:52,02
Maybe more comfortable next time passed slower. But when you relax times passes more slowly.

880
01:29:52,3 --> 01:30:00,64
And there's a sense of the sense that. For some stuff on to negotiations conflict. Solution.

881
01:30:00,96 --> 01:30:02,75
What sort of space should they.

882
01:30:02,76 --> 01:30:07,65
Yeah fighting parties be in there's a painkiller matter you asked as a lighting matter you asked of the chair you

883
01:30:07,65 --> 01:30:12,29
sitting on that I guess are certain phrases that might work better than others but undoubtedly.

884
01:30:15,31 --> 01:30:38,05
So what you're saying is that it will make you use them right. Yeah. Mostly from the U.S. Military.

885
01:30:39,07 --> 01:30:43,09
Is very strange that you get an email from colonels

886
01:30:43,09 --> 01:30:47,48
and so please send me some stuff can you give us quite conference to our.

887
01:30:48,76 --> 01:30:53,03
You do that and then the next week say our first time something is on the paper

888
01:30:53,03 --> 01:30:58,1
and send them a matter of control by which time the e-mail accounts go black doesn't exist. Never existed.

889
01:30:58,23 --> 01:31:05,11
Two or three times so they do get in touch if it's a real name or not and we pass on some information.

890
01:31:06,03 --> 01:31:11,38
I think is useful. Little of interest in the maintenance of surveillance.

891
01:31:12,71 --> 01:31:18,91
If I'm trying to detect a potential terrorist threat or aggressive incident when I've got my cameras.

892
01:31:18,97 --> 01:31:24,22
We've got more C.C.T.V. Than anybody else but if i also the microphone and I could to sense.

893
01:31:24,63 --> 01:31:28,49
With that could be more information and if so what. How would I combine.

894
01:31:29,26 --> 01:31:35,55
The sound from the microphone with the scanning image. So there is interest there and try to sort of build.

895
01:31:36,28 --> 01:31:42,18
What we've evolved naturally this multi-sensory perception and you build it in engineer it into robots

896
01:31:42,18 --> 01:31:47,86
and surveillance systems and other types of equipment

897
01:31:47,86 --> 01:31:56,31
and stuff through to work on alerting people if you know if I can make a car driver hit the brakes half a second faster

898
01:31:56,31 --> 01:31:59,63
and you make a soldier shoot somebody.

899
01:32:00,59 --> 01:32:09,35
Almost as much better as well through a long term kind of a pop up for long term performance. In the field of.

900
01:32:10,64 --> 01:32:17,28
I want to tell my operative what to do but if I say Oh. Hank. Should be left then the oppositional here.

901
01:32:17,61 --> 01:32:22,31
So maybe if I have a vibrating suit I can. I can communicate without sound without vision.

902
01:32:22,6 --> 01:32:23,86
So the other senses are left open.

903
01:32:23,89 --> 01:32:24,72
That's of interest

904
01:32:24,99 --> 01:32:33,12
and we've been working on vibrating body devices through for those who don't like very long term missions say if you're

905
01:32:33,12 --> 01:32:39,15
on a or those intercontinental refueling or long distance bombing routes.

906
01:32:40,41 --> 01:32:42,25
How do you keep your pilot awake for long enough.

907
01:32:43,12 --> 01:32:45,46
Nice to talk pills and stuff but now there's work

908
01:32:45,46 --> 01:32:52,68
and if I if I capture the blue light of dawn that can trick brain into things dual time to wake up

909
01:32:53,17 --> 01:33:00,91
and Swedish truck drivers through military pilots can be kept more alert for longer thought of playing with the sensors

910
01:33:00,91 --> 01:33:02,16
in that way. So a lot of potential.

911
01:33:03,18 --> 01:33:05,53
And I guess we've done bits

912
01:33:05,53 --> 01:33:20,85
and pieces with the Dutch kind of military research partly military research that you don't see as examples where for

913
01:33:20,85 --> 01:33:21,42
simulations.

914
01:33:21,79 --> 01:33:26,67
It is important whether it was the soldiers simulating what's going to light when they're fighting somewhere new.

915
01:33:26,76 --> 01:33:32,1
Or if it's for the doctors simulating what can be like operating in a military hospital in a war zone.

916
01:33:32,28 --> 01:33:39,23
It's forty degrees in a tent with dust in your eye then just showing people a virtual reality doesn't do it where it is.

917
01:33:39,33 --> 01:33:52,54
Really I guess you call it. Maybe it's all meant to reality. So it's something that's a blend of both.

918
01:34:04,29 --> 01:34:11,15
Distinguish like the difference between zero and one so might be say

919
01:34:11,15 --> 01:34:16,49
when it's all sort of virtual It's all constructed without any technologies what can the information is coming from

920
01:34:16,49 --> 01:34:21,07
your eyes and your ears and your nose. There's no direct readout of what's out there in the world.

921
01:34:21,32 --> 01:34:25,11
It's always going to hypothesis generation your brain predicting imagining.

922
01:34:25,46 --> 01:34:29,43
What the world is like and then occasionally testing reality against your model.

923
01:34:30,12 --> 01:34:33,37
So the way we're always living in a virtual world doesn't feel like that.

924
01:34:33,38 --> 01:34:39,8
Wait that's kind of how the brain said look if everybody. There is actually to some degree grounded in.

925
