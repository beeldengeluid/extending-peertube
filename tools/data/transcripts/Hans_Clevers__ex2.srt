100:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,560What do you see?200:00:28,600 --> 00:00:36,320You see that your eyes are forcing patterns in your vision.300:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840For example, you see a kind of interrupted regularity over there...400:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,880There are only dots, there is no line at all, but your eyes see a line.500:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,120However, if you look closely, then it is just dots very close to each other.600:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,760I studied various microscopic images of our cells and tiny organs today...700:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,680And its the same: this is basically also seeing patterns.800:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,600To see where these cells are relative to each other.900:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,960Is it mere appearance, or is it real?1000:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,800Sometimes you look and see patterns you did not expect at all.1100:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,160And this more or less the same thing.1200:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080Here is another example, there is no line at all...1300:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,080It is just two colliding surfaces of dots.1400:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680The eye creates a line.1500:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,040So these patterns have to pop up in your mind...1600:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,040And you have to ask yourself immediately:1700:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,920Is this an actual pattern? Is it real, or my imagination, or coincidence?1800:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,720You will see the very same phenomenon on different places in this painting.1900:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,680What the artist is doing... it is just dots everywhere.2000:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080This seems a kind of sandy road...2100:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,480That is where the mountain lizard walks.2200:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,880The work is called 'Mountain Lizard Dreaming'.2300:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,000She made hundreds of paintings.2400:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,520Its a very symbolic story, for the title always contains something related to dreaming.2500:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,720And they always have a cross, like this one.2600:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,160It is composed of firm strokes.2700:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,920In a way it breaks the entire dot pattern...2800:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,880And at the same time it directs your attention.2900:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,680Once you look to the centre of the piece...3000:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,360Everything starts to move3100:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,160So it is alive?3200:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,680Yes, it is a living painting.
