100:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,720Part of the work is done in offices, with computers, but the vital part remains handwork.200:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,000We work in various laboratories...300:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600This lab, I will open it...400:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,840Is entirely devoted to cultivating human tissue, the tiny organs.500:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,000The environment is completely sterile, hence the lab coats...600:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,320(interviewer) The organoids? Can we see them in this lab?700:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,400Yes, although I am not sure if we can see them right now... shall we just go in?800:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800(interviewer) Yes please900:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,000Do you have something, an organoid, that we can see on the microscope?1000:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000(student) Yes1100:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000The cells are kept cool, so as to limit their growth, the cabinets are dust-free.1200:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,120They are actually borrowed technique from space travel sciences.1300:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,840The air is being filtered, because the bacteria in it fall on the cultures and kill them.1400:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920You can also see the gloves, lab coats...1500:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,000This is a kind of modern Petri dish, actually 12 small Petri dishes on a plate.1600:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,080They contain the nutrients, like carbohydrates and fats, and the grow factors we add.1700:01:43,520 --> 00:01:52,520If you do that correctly you see the organoids growing. We split them manually so that they continue growing.1800:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520This splitting is carried out every week, right?1900:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040(student) Yes.2000:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040These are kidney organoids?2100:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,040Yes, tiny kidneys.2200:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720(interviewer) Is this a potential kidney?2300:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720So far it is just kidney cells, a kidney is an incredibly complex organ.2400:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,000It has multiple layers of cells2500:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,640We have just started this... have you figured out yet what type this is?2600:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,000(student) This is mainly the functional tube part of the kidney.2700:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,800The other part is still in development, we are still working on that.2800:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,800This is nevertheless an important part of the kidney, and we can cultivate it quite well.2900:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800A kidney is very complex, we probably have to cultivate several components independently.3000:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200When we put everything together, my prediction would be...3100:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200That nature works in a way that instigates the spontaenous generation of a kidney.3200:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,160We are not there yet, but the great thing is, we can cultivate these cells from urine.3300:03:00,200 --> 00:03:09,200There are always kidney cells in urine. You can use the urine from patients and healthy persons.3400:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200(interviewer) So this is alive?3500:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200This is growing, yes, but it is now cooling down slowly.3600:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,200However, at a temperature of about 37 degrees celsius, you can witness the cell division.3700:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,200Tomorrow this organoid is probably too big, so we then have to fragmentize it.3800:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200So it will fragmentize, but thereafter reorganise itself, become an organoid, and grow again.3900:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,200There is no end to this process. If we know the initial conditions, which are different for every organ...4000:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,200It is a bit trial-and-error to come to know the conditions, but you can repeat this endlessly.4100:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,000You can do it 2-3 times a week. Some organoids grow in tenfold measure, so if you do that for a year...4200:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000You will have a universe full of intestines, or prostates, perhaps something you would not like...4300:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000We all learned that there is a limit to cell division. Normal cell division has a limit...4400:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000Because we think that endless growth equals cancer. This appears not to be the case.4500:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440How old is this culture?4600:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400(student) This one is 4 months old.4700:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200Growing continuously.4800:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400(interviewer) But how big is this culture in reality?4900:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,400(student) This is about one milimeter, actually.5000:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000You can see them with the naked eye.5100:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000If you dare to lift the cover... bacteria and dust will fall in the dish, that is really bad.5200:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000You can see little globules, that is where these structures are in, there's a little condense so a bit hard to see...5300:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000(interviewer) You are holding a small box with life!5400:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000(student) That's right.5500:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000(student) So I have to look trough the microscope as I usually do?5600:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000Here are thin slices of organoid tissue, packed on small glass.5700:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000There is not that much to see, but there is a variety of ways, colour tagging methods...5800:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000To make a variety of things visible in the tissue.5900:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000This is classic stuff, what happens in a hospital, for example.6000:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000Purple is a general colour, different tints of purple reveal inflammations, normal tissue, viruses, and so on.6100:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,000(interviewer) Can you identify these things as well?6200:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,840For intestines - this is from a mouse, I can in this case, but pathologists know hundreds of diseases...6300:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,840I have to look up things and consult others. Also, mice are not humans, so its different.6400:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840This is very important in a lab: music. There are endless discussions...6500:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,840Music on? Music off? What kind of music? We now have two labs: one without and one with music.6600:07:07,840 --> 00:07:17,840This is also quite standard. With the help of an electromagnetic field and a fluid...6700:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,840You can transfer tiny bits of DNA from the one side of the device to the other.6800:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,840Bigger pieces tend to transfer slower, that is how we separate bits of DNA.6900:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,840Think of typical images of forensic DNA research.7000:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,840Producing a lot of DNA, cutting it into pieces, and comparing the pattern to the DNA of the potential culprit.7100:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,840It is just basic molecular biology.7200:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,840(interviewer) You do not have to show everything, only the things vital for your reserach.7300:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,000This is the molecular biologist's essential tool. They are property like a pistol, or violin. It does the work.7400:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000P20. You set it, and basically what you do is extracting and injecting fluids.7500:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000That is the way to design every step in the DNA.7600:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000It happens always in this kind of tube.7700:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000If I want to cut the DNA, I add an enzyme, precisely on one location, which cuts it.7800:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000Then you have two pieces, which I can mix, add, you name it.7900:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000This is the core of molecular biology.8000:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000This is the microscope and we see the organoid sample on the screen. You see lasers, cabinets, and so on...8100:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000Biologists never build their own devices. Physicists do. We work with industry and usually buy devices.8200:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,880This is beautiful. Can you turn it?8300:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880This is the size of a normal liver.8400:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,880Every red area is one cell. You can see the nuclei.8500:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,880Blue is a nucleus, purple is the boundary of the cells.8600:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,880In all of these cells, there is at least one nucleus.8700:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,880It is a bit difficult to see... can you see all the nuclei?8800:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,640(student) It is difficult. Unfortunately, we don't really see the boundaries between the cells.8900:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,640The flipside is beautiful, with the nuclei...9000:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,640A liver has two cell types: we colour them red and green, and we see this liver generates them both.9100:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640(interviewer) But you add these colours.9200:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,640Yes, but the possibilities are endless. It depends on what is informative.9300:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,640The student tries to make much more tissue in three dimensoins. He uses a nylon threads...9400:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,640The nylon meshwork apparently enhances the growth of the tissues quite well.9500:10:57,640 --> 00:11:06,640Together we thought of implementing the meshwork in patients, but made from biodegradables.9600:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,640It may support this particular tissue structure. We ordered it, we hope that it works out for us.9700:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,640What you see is a plug, it is only half a centimeter big, we could implement it in a liver.9800:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,640Probably it will grow quite easily from there. We see that happening in mice already.
