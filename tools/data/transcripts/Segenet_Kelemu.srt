1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,98
Speaker 1: Why did you actually choose plant pathology?

2
00:00:02,98 --> 00:00:06,23
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good question.

3
00:00:06,23 --> 00:00:10,3
There are many different areas I could have picked,

4
00:00:11,84 --> 00:00:25,95
but I had a very good professor who taught us how actually plants get sick like humans, like animals,

5
00:00:26,28 --> 00:00:34,84
plants also get a lot of diseases. Bacterial diseases, viral diseases, fungal diseases, a myriad of diseases.

6
00:00:35,4 --> 00:00:44,45
And if they get sick then we have no food, so that was really in a simplified way, that was the reason.

7
00:00:44,63 --> 00:00:52,83
And I found it very interesting also, the science of plant pathology, which is diseases of plants.

8
00:00:52,83 --> 00:00:59,2
Speaker 1: You went to South America. What did you do in South America?

9
00:00:59,2 --> 00:01:11,85
Speaker 2: So, I studied my undergraduate degree in Ethiopia and I got scholarship went to United States.

10
00:01:12,04 --> 00:01:20,64
That's what I really wanted to do and so I studied there and I had I did my masters degree

11
00:01:20,65 --> 00:01:32,2
and my PhD degree in America and I had, also after my PhD, I had a job as a scientist in the USA, in Cornell University.

12
00:01:34,48 --> 00:01:41,95
So after that I was recruited by an international Agricultural Research Center based in Colombia.

13
00:01:42,92 --> 00:01:49,84
So I had never been in Colombia before. They approached me to consider a job there.

14
00:01:50,36 --> 00:01:57,41
So I was employed by the organization as a senior scientist and I moved there in Colombia. Yeah.

15
00:01:57,41 --> 00:01:58,51
Speaker 1: What did you do in Colombia?

16
00:01:58,51 --> 00:02:06,77
Speaker 2: In Colombia so I was a senior scientist in charge of diseases of forage plants.

17
00:02:06,77 --> 00:02:13,57
And it is a very enjoyable setting, enjoyable job.

18
00:02:14,27 --> 00:02:20,44
Because everything we did was to solve a problem for society, particularly for developing countries.

19
00:02:20,44 --> 00:02:27,96
And it is a great phase for me and I get to learn a new language in Spanish.

20
00:02:28,23 --> 00:02:34,74
The people are nice and the country is beautiful, and I met my husband there also.

21
00:02:35,12 --> 00:02:37,69
He was at the same time

22
00:02:37,7 --> 00:02:46,31
when I was recruited from United States the same company recruited him also from the Netherlands from his country,

23
00:02:46,83 --> 00:02:53,24
and we met one day apart, we arrived there one day apart, basically yeah.

24
00:02:53,57 --> 00:03:04,3
So, and then our daughter was also born there, in Colombia, so and both of us agree

25
00:03:04,3 --> 00:03:09,75
and was a scientist was in the organization also, so it was very good.

26
00:03:09,87 --> 00:03:16,46
And we, I feel we made a lot of difference for people.

27
00:03:16,64 --> 00:03:22,47
We were working for, basically the developing world in South America, in Asia,

28
00:03:22,65 --> 00:03:28,29
in Africa just based in Columbia so it was a very good time.

29
00:03:28,29 --> 00:03:31,35
Speaker 1: You also educated a lot of Chinese students.

30
00:03:31,35 --> 00:03:32,38
Speaker 2: Yes.

31
00:03:32,38 --> 00:03:33,8
Speaker 1: So you became a friend of China.

32
00:03:33,8 --> 00:03:47,85
Speaker 2: Yes I did so I think one of the exciting things is that in that organization you are a scientist for any

33
00:03:48,15 --> 00:03:50,64
developing countries that need your skills and technologies.

34
00:03:51,66 --> 00:03:55,21
So you are not particularly working for just one country or the other.

35
00:03:55,21 --> 00:04:03,8
So, many different students, graduate students, came to work with me. So among those was many Chinese.

36
00:04:04,68 --> 00:04:13,75
So the Chinese were partially funded by their government. So they came to do their research in my laboratory.

37
00:04:13,75 --> 00:04:21,22
So they are really hard-working people, and I spend considerable amount of time also training them.

38
00:04:23,78 --> 00:04:31,48
So that was my one of the success stories and I had Columbian students, I had Brazilians, I had many different kinds.

39
00:04:31,48 --> 00:04:40,32
Speaker 1: The Chinese, well, it wasn't unnoticed that you educated a lot of Chinese people.

40
00:04:40,6 --> 00:04:43,56
You got a medal from the Chinese.

41
00:04:43,56 --> 00:04:44,56
Speaker 2: Yeah.

42
00:04:44,56 --> 00:04:47,9
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go to Africa then?

43
00:04:47,9 --> 00:04:53,43
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, that was a turning point for me.

44
00:04:53,71 --> 00:05:01,61
So all those years, I was in Columbia for 15 years and so agree was a scientist in the organization.

45
00:05:02,39 --> 00:05:08,3
I was promoted also in the organization. So for my career, it was great.

46
00:05:08,66 --> 00:05:22,91
But at the back of my mind, I was also thinking, and really contemplating, also, what is actually my impact for Africa.

47
00:05:23,87 --> 00:05:30,67
Coming from a poor village knowing how people live, struggle to make ends meet.

48
00:05:30,93 --> 00:05:40,59
So I was always questioning also whether that Colombia needs me more than Africa needed me.

49
00:05:40,84 --> 00:05:52,06
But I think the turning point came in September 2006 as the Chinese gave me their highest award,

50
00:05:52,06 --> 00:06:05,87
what they call the Friendship Award, for the role I had played in their agricultural research and developments

51
00:06:05,87 --> 00:06:09,79
Speaker 2: And the impact basically, through the graduate students I trained,

52
00:06:10,41 --> 00:06:20,6
who had become very successful scientists back in China. So, at the ceremony, there was a big ceremony there.

53
00:06:20,6 --> 00:06:28,44
And on the stage, when it was announced that at that time from Ethiopia and I made this contribution to China.

54
00:06:29,84 --> 00:06:35,49
It was another proud moment for me. I was embarrassed.

55
00:06:35,94 --> 00:06:50,68
I was from a poor country and I was getting a gold medal from the premier of China for impact made in China.

56
00:06:47,22 --> 00:06:55,02
and I was cautioning on the [INAUDIBLE] Does actually China need me more than Africa?

57
00:06:56,09 --> 00:07:03,39
So that was the stage actually on the stage right there I decided okay I'm going back to Africa. So yeah.

58
00:07:03,39 --> 00:07:06,36
Speaker 1: You became finally in Africa.

59
00:07:06,36 --> 00:07:06,66
Speaker 2: Yeah.

60
00:07:06,66 --> 00:07:11,49
Speaker 1: And director of this insect institute. Why an insect institute?

61
00:07:11,49 --> 00:07:22,08
Speaker 2: Yeah, so when I came back to Africa I was immediately the head of this institute.

62
00:07:23,03 --> 00:07:33,12
So I was recruited by another international organization based here in Nairobi to establish agricultural power

63
00:07:33,51 --> 00:07:37,89
technology center for Africa, funded by the Canadian government.

64
00:07:38,22 --> 00:07:46,94
So, it was a tough a job, but after the task but it give me opportunity to do something from scratch for Africa.

65
00:07:47,17 --> 00:07:53,89
So I did that for five and a half years to establish the center. It became a very successful center.

66
00:07:53,89 --> 00:07:56,31
I did the lot of money.

67
00:07:56,31 --> 00:08:04,15
And send, I save up the program And so on, so then I was approached by another organization,

68
00:08:04,57 --> 00:08:08,92
if I could take the position of a Vice President for Programs.

69
00:08:10,61 --> 00:08:22,87
So I accepted that, but it was not a research organization, so I wanted to go back into the research organization.

70
00:08:25,51 --> 00:08:33,41
This opportunity came to head ICIPE, the International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology.

71
00:08:34,21 --> 00:08:44,68
So I accepted that and so it is a perfect place for me with perfect programs for Africa. So why insects?

72
00:08:44,92 --> 00:08:54,25
So people often ask me, wow, the whole organization for just insects? And why insects? That's what people ask, yeah.

73
00:08:54,25 --> 00:08:57,01
But, yeah, this is a unique organization.

74
00:08:58,05 --> 00:09:03,25
I think, as far as I know, the only organization that deals 100% on insects,

75
00:09:06,3 --> 00:09:09,36
because insects are extremely important in our lives.

76
00:09:10,33 --> 00:09:21,78
They are by far the most diverse and the most abundant animals on earth. They play various roles in our lives.

77
00:09:22,85 --> 00:09:28,08
If you take bees, they play a critical role in pollinating our crops.

78
00:09:28,63 --> 00:09:35,5
So if bees have to disappear tomorrow, our food source would be in big, big trouble.

79
00:09:39,07 --> 00:09:43,14
So they pollinate our crops, like bees.

80
00:09:44,03 --> 00:09:53,08
Insects also play a critical role as food source, food for humans and feed for animals.

81
00:09:54,18 --> 00:10:03,82
So about 2 billion people in Africa, Latin America, Asia, consume insects as a source of protein.

82
00:10:03,82 --> 00:10:10,68
So I believe this is also actually a source that has to be mainstream all across, I think,

83
00:10:10,81 --> 00:10:23,69
the globe as a good source of high quality protein. Also bees give us also a lot of things, food, feed.

84
00:10:23,87 --> 00:10:31,78
I mean, insects and wax and a range of things.

85
00:10:32,7 --> 00:10:41,01
Insects also, they have also ecologically also there are insects that control other harmful insects also.

86
00:10:41,59 --> 00:10:49,87
Insects play role also in degrading waste, plant waste, animal waste, and so on.

87
00:10:50,42 --> 00:10:58,84
So in fact, if we don't have insects, our world will be a lot of, really mess, with a lot of garbage.

88
00:10:59,64 --> 00:11:06,64
A lot of waste that we put which is not being degraded by some microbes and insects.

89
00:11:08,13 --> 00:11:17,3
But unfortunately, also that insects also are harmful to also humans, animals, to crops.

90
00:11:17,96 --> 00:11:20,67
They transmit a lot of disease.

91
00:11:21,74 --> 00:11:32,39
Small things like mosquitoes kill more people every day than global conflicts put together.

92
00:11:32,39 --> 00:11:42,32
So it hurts me to think with all the technologies we have, humans going, mankind going to the moon, going to space,

93
00:11:42,57 --> 00:11:47,33
and so on. We are unable to defeat a tiny mosquito, to kill.

94
00:11:47,51 --> 00:12:00,26
Every 80 seconds in Africa, children die from malaria, from a lot of mosquito transmitted diseases, dengue,

95
00:12:00,82 --> 00:12:09,45
and yellow fever. And a lot of diseases come through that, transmitted through insects.

96
00:12:10,00 --> 00:12:18,93
The same for animal diseases also. A wide range of animal diseases are transmitted through insects.

97
00:12:21,48 --> 00:12:25,00
So climate change is an issue.

98
00:12:25,28 --> 00:12:36,99
A recent report for example says, by the World Bank just came out, if we don't deal with climate change by 2030,

99
00:12:36,99 --> 00:12:40,47
100 million more people will go into poverty.

100
00:12:41,07 --> 00:12:49,38
So I think, I believe personally, that I think one of the biggest impacts of climate change is going to be insects,

101
00:12:49,38 --> 00:12:56,69
also. As the world gets warmer, insects are going to shift also to warmer places.

102
00:12:57,35 --> 00:13:03,25
A lot of African problems are going to be also problems somewhere else as it gets warm.

103
00:13:04,76 --> 00:13:12,97
If we have to make the planet livable for us, in the many years ahead.

104
00:13:13,47 --> 00:13:18,93
If we have to manage our food security, nutritional security.

105
00:13:19,86 --> 00:13:25,92
If we have to develop the planet, we have to develop for the insects.

106
00:13:25,92 --> 00:13:32,07
For the benefits and the harmful parts of what insects provide, yeah.

107
00:13:32,07 --> 00:13:38,74
Speaker 1: Are people aware of somehow of this wide variety of properties that insects have?

108
00:13:38,74 --> 00:13:48,9
Speaker 2: Mm, no, unfortunately not. I think we have to make people aware of that, I think we have to teach.

109
00:13:48,9 --> 00:13:56,04
Speaker 1: Would you mind repeating my question? Sort of because otherwise you answer with yes or no.

110
00:13:56,04 --> 00:13:56,76
Speaker 2: Yeah.

111
00:13:56,76 --> 00:14:02,28
Speaker 1: So you think are people aware somehow of the wide variety of properties?

112
00:14:02,28 --> 00:14:14,05
Speaker 2: No, I think people are not aware of all this variety of issues associated with insects.

113
00:14:15,17 --> 00:14:23,67
So for example, if you take bees, almost everybody knows that honey comes from bees.

114
00:14:24,37 --> 00:14:32,02
But a lot of people don't know that bees are critical for food securities, they pollinate crops.

115
00:14:32,02 --> 00:14:41,47
Without bees and you don't have enough and some of the plants they require pollination by bees.

116
00:14:42,51 --> 00:14:46,6
So, no, people don't know a lot about this.

117
00:14:47,49 --> 00:14:53,89
And I think we have to teach it in school, in elementary school, in high school, in universities.

118
00:14:54,8 --> 00:15:02,28
And I think in the general public, also to be aware of what insects do for people, yeah.

119
00:15:02,28 --> 00:15:08,48
Speaker 1: Are there properties you think that are very beneficial from insects?

120
00:15:09,51 --> 00:15:15,25
I mean, in terms of pharmaceutical properties, or anything they do well for us.

121
00:15:15,25 --> 00:15:19,64
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah insects play a lot of roles.

122
00:15:20,02 --> 00:15:28,82
For example, there are insects that are uniquely found antibiotics, insects that uniquely produce

123
00:15:28,82 --> 00:15:30,7
or have antibiotics for example.

124
00:15:30,7 --> 00:15:31,52
Speaker 1: Should we do it again?

125
00:15:31,52 --> 00:15:33,1
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.

126
00:15:33,1 --> 00:15:38,62
Speaker 1: Can you mention some other, well, quite unique properties that we are not very aware of?

127
00:15:38,62 --> 00:15:51,06
Speaker 2: Yeah, insects have a number of other uses as well. For example, the antibiotics for people, for animals.

128
00:15:52,42 --> 00:15:59,37
I don't think we have investigated enough the unique antibiotics that exist in insects.

129
00:16:01,09 --> 00:16:10,09
There are also other things that, for example, this insect called the soldier fly.

130
00:16:10,09 --> 00:16:16,87
There are very good at processing a lot of waste, and converting them to fertilizer.

131
00:16:18,11 --> 00:16:26,78
So yeah, there is a wide variety of use we can make out of insects.

132
00:16:27,86 --> 00:16:37,65
Some of the airplane, helicopter design comes from insects, insect architecture, yeah. Yeah, so.

133
00:16:37,65 --> 00:16:41,44
Speaker 1: What the uniqueness of your institute?

134
00:16:41,44 --> 00:16:48,77
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think the uniqueness for me of this, of ICIPE, is one.

135
00:16:49,11 --> 00:17:01,27
It is focused on really solving agricultural and housing constraints in Africa.

136
00:17:02,19 --> 00:17:06,98
But what we produce is not just unique for Africa, it can be used globally.

137
00:17:06,98 --> 00:17:17,95
It is also, we also focus on very environmentally-friendly and sustainable technologies and products.

138
00:17:18,71 --> 00:17:27,62
We have, for example, over the years, generated biopesticides, pesticides that come naturally,

139
00:17:27,62 --> 00:17:34,88
from a naturally existing fungus. And we manage,

140
00:17:34,88 --> 00:17:41,58
Speaker 2: Insects, beneficial, not beneficial, harmful insects.

141
00:17:43,21 --> 00:17:50,84
So these products now, are commercialized together with, in partnership with the private sector.

142
00:17:51,46 --> 00:17:57,31
And so, it's registered now, they are registered in many countries in Africa.

143
00:17:57,8 --> 00:18:01,52
And currently, they're being registered, so, in the European Union.

144
00:18:02,2 --> 00:18:07,48
So what we produce, very environmentally-friendly, and not contaminating the environment.

145
00:18:08,34 --> 00:18:14,8
Not harming other beneficial insects. So it's not only just useful for Africa.

146
00:18:15,06 --> 00:18:18,96
But this can be used anywhere else, as well, in Europe, in North America.

147
00:18:19,42 --> 00:18:25,74
So we are unique, in the sense that we focus on technologies and products that are environmentally-friendly.

148
00:18:27,1 --> 00:18:34,97
And that are also sustainable for a long term or so. And that keeps a natural equilibrium also, yeah.

149
00:18:34,97 --> 00:18:41,83
Speaker 1: How important is your institute for Africa, maybe for the world, and how would you describe it?

150
00:18:41,83 --> 00:18:44,37
Speaker 2: I think it's very, very important.

151
00:18:44,82 --> 00:18:57,33
I often ask my staff, that if we cease to exist tomorrow, would people line up asking for reopening of ICIPE?

152
00:19:00,58 --> 00:19:08,95
And the answer is constantly yes. Because we are making a major impact, all across Africa.

153
00:19:09,38 --> 00:19:18,51
And we are focused on major constraints. Constraints that are really an impediment for agricultural, and those issues.

154
00:19:19,43 --> 00:19:27,94
So, is a very important organization for the continent, and globally as well, yeah.

155
00:19:27,94 --> 00:19:29,45
Speaker 1: Why is it in Africa?

156
00:19:29,45 --> 00:19:37,05
Speaker 2: Why is it in Africa, good question. It's based in Africa because it was founded by an African.

157
00:19:37,54 --> 00:19:46,33
It was founded 45 years ago, in 1970, by a very renowned entomologist, insect scientist.

158
00:19:48,16 --> 00:19:50,42
A professor, a Kenyan professor.

159
00:19:53,36 --> 00:20:00,68
So it was founded as an international center, a small center within a university, and it expanded.

160
00:20:01,86 --> 00:20:09,83
It expanded, and so today we have multiple nationalities of scientists and technical staff.

161
00:20:13,63 --> 00:20:17,19
And reaching out across Africa and making impact.

162
00:20:17,44 --> 00:20:23,15
And what I like about the organization is also that research, yeah, we do cutting-edge research.

163
00:20:23,82 --> 00:20:31,29
We do, we make major breakthroughs, we publish in high quality journals internationally.

164
00:20:32,35 --> 00:20:38,6
But all that, our work, is also is aimed to translate it to impact.

165
00:20:38,6 --> 00:20:45,88
There's nothing we do, which is not short-term, or middle-term, or long-term, is not translated to impact.

166
00:20:46,4 --> 00:20:53,44
And products that reach the end user, which is the farmers and the beneficiaries in Africa and beyond.

167
00:20:54,00 --> 00:21:04,93
And so this really truly making science to work for people, for society.

168
00:21:04,93 --> 00:21:10,98
Speaker 1: Can you describe how important insects are for the future of humanity?

169
00:21:10,98 --> 00:21:17,87
Speaker 2: Yeah, excellent, very good question. Yeah, I think insects are really important for all our lives.

170
00:21:17,87 --> 00:21:27,21
Bees, I think bees. Europe and North America already knows now, because the bee population is going declining.

171
00:21:27,98 --> 00:21:36,15
Already knows that this is a problem, unless we solve this. Unless we take care of the house of the bees.

172
00:21:38,42 --> 00:21:45,35
So that one, I think it goes without saying. That if bees, if they don't exist today, tomorrow, we're in trouble.

173
00:21:46,42 --> 00:21:51,96
So that has to go on for the future.

174
00:21:52,85 --> 00:22:02,37
I think for the future also, that if we have to diversify our food source, feed source.

175
00:22:03,53 --> 00:22:09,82
And quality of protein, I think we have to mainstream the use of insects as food.

176
00:22:10,59 --> 00:22:16,26
So there is, there are a variety, more than 2,000 species of insects are consumed globally.

177
00:22:16,26 --> 00:22:27,28
And there are several of them in Africa. So people consume them, they go to the forest, they collect them seasonally.

178
00:22:28,32 --> 00:22:34,59
Often it is women and children who are tasked, who are given this task. To go to the forest and collect the insects.

179
00:22:35,4 --> 00:22:41,42
So sometimes when you collect them, so that you are going to, there is a tendency to over-harvest.

180
00:22:42,85 --> 00:22:51,17
And then you can cause some of these insects trouble, their role in balancing the, the atmosphere, the equilibrium.

181
00:22:51,5 --> 00:23:02,09
So, and, ICIPE has technology, the capability to mass-raise a lot of these species of insects.

182
00:23:02,09 --> 00:23:10,29
And so, I think we have to change the perception of people, globally.

183
00:23:11,38 --> 00:23:15,65
That insects, I mean, consuming insects, is not something out of the ordinary.

184
00:23:16,18 --> 00:23:22,66
Two billion people have successfully been traditionally consuming them. We have to do the mainstream also.

185
00:23:23,11 --> 00:23:34,09
So the conversion rate also, of feed, and insect protein, is a lot more efficient in insects.

186
00:23:34,54 --> 00:23:41,32
So with a very limited amount of feed, substrate insects, you can get high-quality protein.

187
00:23:42,59 --> 00:24:02,26
Compared to the same quality protein in beef, in cattle. So for climate change, also mitigation for, and so on.?

188
00:23:57,5 --> 00:24:02,93
So I think insects are more What more compatible I think, yeah. More susceptible

189
00:24:02,93 --> 00:24:09,39
Speaker 1: One of your research is actually published in article about locust.

190
00:24:09,94 --> 00:24:13,38
You could better eat a locust that eat the food they eat.

191
00:24:13,38 --> 00:24:14,1
Speaker 2: Yeah.

192
00:24:14,1 --> 00:24:16,75
Speaker 1: Why? Can you explain that? What was, what did you?

193
00:24:16,75 --> 00:24:24,42
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we have been working going them On a device insects also the protein

194
00:24:24,43 --> 00:24:30,68
and nutritional profile of these insects also, the number of insects that are being consumed traditionally.

195
00:24:31,08 --> 00:24:40,4
So we found that a lot of these insects actually have a higher or equivalent content of nutrition

196
00:24:40,41 --> 00:24:47,64
and protein to equivalent to fish and to beef. So that is a good finding.

197
00:24:48,07 --> 00:24:55,19
Locusts, so we published a recently about two months ago, a paper. Very exciting the finding.

198
00:24:55,42 --> 00:25:00,19
So locusts are really big pests.

199
00:25:00,27 --> 00:25:06,12
They go and they kind in they storm and they can completely wipe your crop in an overnight.

200
00:25:06,35 --> 00:25:10,92
They consume a lot of granary crops or any vegetation.

201
00:25:12,58 --> 00:25:17,6
But people also consumes them traditionally also in many parts of Africa and elsewhere.

202
00:25:18,1 --> 00:25:29,3
But what we found is that locust is that in a laboratory setting, that are feed on wheat seedlings.

203
00:25:31,44 --> 00:25:36,17
They convert the wheat seedlings may have very minute amount of steroids.

204
00:25:36,17 --> 00:25:40,45
These are chemicals that are very useful to our health.

205
00:25:40,67 --> 00:25:45,81
They reduce cholesterol, they do a lot of have a lot of benefit to health.

206
00:25:46,69 --> 00:25:53,39
And so the locusts as it consume and then they have, we don't know the mechanisms there yet,

207
00:25:54,11 --> 00:26:00,75
they have then capacity to convert this steroids 20 to 40 fold.

208
00:26:01,49 --> 00:26:09,57
So if you have diet, locust based diet all across in your life incorporated into your diet,

209
00:26:09,78 --> 00:26:20,35
that the chance of you having a cholesterol or a heart problem is much, much lower. So this is a an amazing finding.

210
00:26:20,35 --> 00:26:31,07
So, I think if more and more if we find the beneficial effect of insects as food.

211
00:26:31,34 --> 00:26:38,51
I think the perception of people will also change on incorporating insects into their diet sir.

212
00:26:38,51 --> 00:26:42,85
Speaker 1: What will insect research do for the future of Africa?

213
00:26:43,18 --> 00:26:55,8
Yeah, I think if we have effectively understand on, we are constantly understanding the insects, their physiologist,

214
00:26:55,8 --> 00:27:02,84
their ecologist, their mechanism. How they transmit the diseases, how they're fascinating creatures sir?

215
00:27:02,84 --> 00:27:07,76
Speaker 2: Creatures and if we understand that our better.

216
00:27:08,36 --> 00:27:14,39
If we know, then we identify then several cycles in their life cycles severalspots where,

217
00:27:15,71 --> 00:27:20,78
the weak spots where we can manage. So, I think we have to eradicate malaria.

218
00:27:21,44 --> 00:27:26,95
So, why can't we with all this technology? Not just us, but the global scientific community.

219
00:27:27,61 --> 00:27:29,37
Why can't we eradicate dengue?

220
00:27:29,37 --> 00:27:35,77
Why can't we eradicate sees flies that are causing a lot of problem both in humans and in animals?

221
00:27:35,77 --> 00:27:43,86
So, I think if we tackle all of these I think the future of Africa will be bright.

222
00:27:44,59 --> 00:27:46,96
It will be less problem to deal with.

223
00:27:46,96 --> 00:27:54,42
And so, a lot of the problems that you find in Africa, they're actually manageable, we can manage them,

224
00:27:54,76 --> 00:27:56,22
we can tackle them.

225
00:27:57,17 --> 00:28:04,19
So it's not so, yeah, we regularly make breakthroughs,

226
00:28:04,5 --> 00:28:10,92
we recently that the a young group of scientist this is are CPA in my organization.

227
00:28:11,89 --> 00:28:21,34
They discovered that certain mosquitoes, a certain population of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria.

228
00:28:21,34 --> 00:28:30,1
And about a very small portion of them we don't know why they harbor bacteria in their body.

229
00:28:30,88 --> 00:28:41,01
So those mosquitoes that harbor this bacteria, they are unable to transmit the malaria parasite.

230
00:28:41,01 --> 00:28:49,28
So that is a major, major discovery. So what we have to what we are doing is that why?

231
00:28:51,01 --> 00:28:55,18
What do this bacteria do to this insect making them resistant

232
00:28:55,48 --> 00:29:09,51
and incapable of transmitting the malaria transmitting the malaria parasite??

233
00:29:04,15 --> 00:29:09,18
And why only certain population, certain percentage of them, and the mosquito have it.

234
00:29:10,35 --> 00:29:20,95
So if we knows that, and if we are able to transmit this bacteria to a wider range of the mosquito population.

235
00:29:22,23 --> 00:29:26,14
It is possible to significantly reduce the malaria transmission.

236
00:29:27,13 --> 00:29:34,3
So there is a lot of things we can do, and make a difference in Africa and elsewhere.

237
00:29:34,3 --> 00:29:40,44
Speaker 1: People I talk to say you are in a hurry. What does that mean?

238
00:29:40,44 --> 00:29:44,51
Speaker 2: [LAUGH] I'm in a hurry. I"m in hurry. I'm very impatient.

239
00:29:44,51 --> 00:29:53,78
Yeah, because I think and I, if you talk to my staff also they'll tell you the same thing. I'm in a hurry.

240
00:29:54,13 --> 00:29:55,42
I'm pushing constantly.

241
00:29:55,42 --> 00:30:03,71
I'm impatient that is because I think we have to live our lives with a sense of urgency,

242
00:30:04,23 --> 00:30:10,29
because every day we live that tomorrow, we are about to finish today.

243
00:30:11,07 --> 00:30:21,19
Tomorrow we have one day less on our life, our lifetime. So, which means that we are not getting younger.

244
00:30:21,75 --> 00:30:31,5
So we have to rush in to make sure that we have actually make a difference in people's lives, that we have lived, also,

245
00:30:31,51 --> 00:30:37,17
our lives with a purpose. So, I think we shouldn't, I don't feel that I have to live for myself.

246
00:30:37,31 --> 00:30:45,63
No, I shouldn't live for myself. I should feel a sense of responsibility for my other fellow human beings.

247
00:30:46,9 --> 00:30:50,15
So that's why I'm in a hurry. I'm really in a hurry, yeah.

248
00:30:50,15 --> 00:30:51,55
Speaker 1: What's the goal?

249
00:30:51,55 --> 00:30:58,33
Speaker 2: I want to do something, I want to make a difference for people I want to,

250
00:30:58,33 --> 00:31:08,99
Speaker 2: To solve a problems for people who are not able to solve it themselves. And I think we are fortunate.

251
00:31:09,47 --> 00:31:17,07
As a scientist, I'm fortunate that I'm given this priceless knowledge and education.

252
00:31:17,85 --> 00:31:26,72
So I have to use it, to, use it to publish a paper, but only to really use, to solve people's problems, yeah.

253
00:31:26,72 --> 00:31:31,02
Speaker 1: What can science do for Africa, in this respect?

254
00:31:31,02 --> 00:31:36,25
Speaker 2: Science can do a lot of things for Africa, and for the rest of the world,

255
00:31:36,44 --> 00:31:44,34
I think We should be able to find solution for all our ailings.

256
00:31:46,6 --> 00:31:58,04
We should be finding vaccine for malaria, we should be finding vaccine for HIV/AIDS. We should be defeating cancer.

257
00:31:58,73 --> 00:32:05,59
So that's all possible I think. So science can do a lot of different things too for people and for the planet, yeah.

258
00:32:05,59 --> 00:32:08,58
Speaker 1: What can Africa do for science.

259
00:32:08,58 --> 00:32:11,72
Speaker 2: Africa can do a lot of things for science.

260
00:32:11,94 --> 00:32:20,42
I think that's an excellent question that no one has ever asked me. I think governments have to value the science.

261
00:32:22,83 --> 00:32:27,66
Technology is really important for the continent development for the people.

262
00:32:28,44 --> 00:32:39,05
So they have to value that, they have to invest significant proportion of their resources to science and technology

263
00:32:39,94 --> 00:32:41,1
and to other areas.

264
00:32:41,55 --> 00:32:47,84
Because I think the difference between my country and your country, which is my husband's country,

265
00:32:48,48 --> 00:32:58,21
is not a difference in our color, is not a difference in the location where we are, is a difference of capability

266
00:32:59,33 --> 00:33:00,23
and education.

267
00:33:01,14 --> 00:33:11,15
That investment, and the capability capacity of people to innovate, capacity of people to absorb new technologies,

268
00:33:11,86 --> 00:33:15,15
and to invent a lot of different things.

269
00:33:15,58 --> 00:33:21,47
If we don't do that, if Africa doesn't do that, it's never going to solve a lot of our problems.

270
00:33:22,05 --> 00:33:33,4
So how is that the Netherlands which has miserable weather and can produce a lot of food not only for their people

271
00:33:33,41 --> 00:33:34,79
but I think can produce a lot.

272
00:33:35,44 --> 00:33:43,86
And we have this beautiful weather, beautiful sunshine, and a lot of resources, water and everything else

273
00:33:43,87 --> 00:33:51,9
and we are not feeding ourselves. So it is again a capability issue for me, yeah.

274
00:33:52,29 --> 00:34:02,29
And knowledge and technology and I think Africa has to do that to enhance it's ability to do.

275
00:34:02,29 --> 00:34:07,65
Speaker 1: What can your institute do for Africa?

276
00:34:07,65 --> 00:34:13,12
Speaker 2: It simply does a lot of things for Africa.

277
00:34:14,15 --> 00:34:20,59
So we, environment work, as I have just said, we believe capacity is very critical.

278
00:34:20,84 --> 00:34:28,25
Capacity, at the end of the day, capacity is development. Development is all about capacity of people.

279
00:34:28,88 --> 00:34:41,77
So we have a very large capacity building unit. So every year, we see 100 to 150 graduate students all across Africa.

280
00:34:44,62 --> 00:34:57,28
They do their masters degree, their PhD degree and, so and then we train them..

281
00:34:52,72 --> 00:34:57,07
They are registered in many different universities but they do the research at this, [INAUDIBLE]

282
00:34:57,92 --> 00:35:07,15
And so we are enhancing the scientific capability of many African countries in insect science.

283
00:35:08,61 --> 00:35:12,59
But also we train also a lot of farmers in different things.

284
00:35:13,15 --> 00:35:21,32
We train in the technologies that they adapt from us and so on.

285
00:35:21,42 --> 00:35:30,43
So like this year, from January until October, ten months, is that? Is that ten months, yeah.

286
00:35:31,51 --> 00:35:34,5
Ten months that we trained more than 10,000 people in various different technologies.

287
00:35:35,1 --> 00:35:41,54
So this is begun, and we are a reluctantly small organization, okay? So I think this is a big contribution.

288
00:35:42,08 --> 00:35:49,99
So we also yeah our products go all across Africa, technologies they go.

289
00:35:51,29 --> 00:35:59,17
So one of the things which is difficult for us is to scale out the technologies to reach as many people as we can.

290
00:35:59,71 --> 00:36:03,97
So for example we have the technologies we are going to visit tomorrow in the field.

291
00:36:04,15 --> 00:36:12,84
Is absolutely fabulous technology, invented, created by and developed by superior and its partners.

292
00:36:14,25 --> 00:36:18,06
But this is a technology that is really needed all across Africa.

293
00:36:18,69 --> 00:36:28,94
But we are reaching only 10,000 to 20,000 farmers per year. But the technology is needed by millions of farmers.

294
00:36:28,94 --> 00:36:35,08
So, now we are changing our model and partnering with governments and with individuals

295
00:36:35,52 --> 00:36:42,51
and in the private sector to take the technology into accelerated and many different countries.

296
00:36:42,83 --> 00:36:45,85
And so yeah, this was, yeah.

297
00:36:45,85 --> 00:36:53,06
Speaker 1: You like to defend this case to many people, and share your thoughts with, wherever you can share,

298
00:36:53,24 --> 00:36:57,08
because you also go to the President of your country, your

299
00:36:57,08 --> 00:37:05,05
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's very important for us to work with the governments

300
00:37:05,62 --> 00:37:13,77
and to fit also with their own strategy plan also. So, we kinda just work in isolation.

301
00:37:14,26 --> 00:37:21,27
So the Ethiopian government, for example, has a very clear strategy development plan.

302
00:37:21,83 --> 00:37:30,57
So they took a number of our, products and technologies, and they fit them into their strategy.

303
00:37:30,57 --> 00:37:39,4
So for one of our technologies, for example, they have a plan to reach minimum of 20,000 farmers with that technology,

304
00:37:39,76 --> 00:37:45,08
a year. So they are going to expand it themselves, I think, once you give them.

305
00:37:45,39 --> 00:37:50,58
And we do the technical backstopping, because it's a very knowledge intensive technology.

306
00:37:51,33 --> 00:37:57,33
So you have to train farmers how to use it. But it's a fabulous technology.

307
00:37:57,33 --> 00:38:05,14
And bee keeping also, that they utilize beekeeping and silk farming, anything insects, that we work on.

308
00:38:05,61 --> 00:38:11,15
Silk farming also is very needed. So it's not just only food security but also income generation.

309
00:38:11,65 --> 00:38:19,98
You want to improve the livelihood of people in various ways. It's not just only producing more food and that's it.

310
00:38:20,08 --> 00:38:25,29
But you want all sorts of diversify their income, rather this, the risk mitigation.

311
00:38:25,91 --> 00:38:35,15
So if you have a diverse income, you are not dependent on one. So you are releasing the risk also, yeah.

312
00:38:35,15 --> 00:38:40,81
Speaker 1: So what would be your ultimate scientific goal?

313
00:38:40,81 --> 00:38:49,94
Speaker 2: Okay, that's a big question. I think I have many goals, but I will make it a more doable one.

314
00:38:51,37 --> 00:38:59,19
So I think, so tomorrow you would see these field visits in the field.

315
00:38:59,42 --> 00:39:10,14
One of the critical problems in across Africa, in many countries is a parasitic weed called striga.

316
00:39:11,85 --> 00:39:18,78
It is a parasite on many cereal crops, on rice, on maize, on sorghum, on millet,

317
00:39:19,16 --> 00:39:23,04
all the staples that people need stable food.

318
00:39:24,51 --> 00:39:34,11
And basically this is a parasitic weed, it attaches itself to the roots of it's host of the maize or sorghum

319
00:39:34,17 --> 00:39:42,7
or whatever. It takes all the nutrients out from this. It cannot live without that host.

320
00:39:43,46 --> 00:39:45,65
And basically it ruins the crop.

321
00:39:46,04 --> 00:39:55,11
So if you have that it also produces thousands of seeds, tiny seeds, and it sheds into the soil.

322
00:39:56,14 --> 00:40:05,01
So once you have that it is really. The soil is basically unusable. So we have technologies that can eradicate that.

323
00:40:05,96 --> 00:40:14,09
So what I really would like to see in my lifetime is eradicating this weed from all across Africa. And it's possible.

324
00:40:14,31 --> 00:40:17,69
We have the technology, what is needed is to scale it out.

325
00:40:18,71 --> 00:40:27,03
To get a large number of partners and funders to say, okay, we are out to eradicate this

326
00:40:27,03 --> 00:40:31,33
and then we are going to solve a major problem, food security problem for Africa.

327
00:40:31,82 --> 00:40:37,13
I would like to see that within my lifetime, and I think it's doable, yeah.

328
00:40:37,13 --> 00:40:41,93
Speaker 1: How important are insects for a more sustainable world?

329
00:40:41,93 --> 00:40:46,27
Speaker 2: They are very important in many angles.

330
00:40:46,27 --> 00:40:56,45
They are important, if you manage them well, they are important in cleaning our environment.

331
00:40:56,45 --> 00:41:06,28
They are important in being the workhorse of farms. They are important as food sources.

332
00:41:06,92 --> 00:41:19,01
I mean, all these chickens that are sold as organic chicken, that are free-roaming in the farm, what do they dig?

333
00:41:19,21 --> 00:41:21,92
They go and dig, and they pick insects.

334
00:41:22,97 --> 00:41:32,33
So you can mass-produce that and produce bigger chicken in a more sustainable way.

335
00:41:32,88 --> 00:41:44,77
Fishery aquaculture, that is also, insects can play a critical role in a more sustainable production system.

336
00:41:44,77 --> 00:41:52,24
Speaker 2: So I can go on and on. I think they are really important, yeah. They are important.

337
00:41:52,24 --> 00:41:58,37
Speaker 1: Also in terms because you want a more sustainable Africa?

338
00:41:58,37 --> 00:42:00,59
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, yeah.

339
00:42:00,94 --> 00:42:06,82
So I think they have even more so here, because we have a myriad of diversity of insects.

340
00:42:07,44 --> 00:42:17,8
As diversity of our ecological zones are big, there are varieties, there are a lot of different plants all year round.

341
00:42:18,48 --> 00:42:26,52
So a lot of these insects also, they rely on plant sugar source as their thing.

342
00:42:26,52 --> 00:42:34,12
Mosquitoes, so you see, many people don't know, mosquitoes, they don't just go and take my blood and they live on that.

343
00:42:34,3 --> 00:42:43,46
They need specific also to sustain them, specific plant nectar as source of sugar.

344
00:42:43,79 --> 00:42:53,63
Insects, more so for Africa, because of our diversity of ecology, diversity of plants, diversity of things.

345
00:42:54,83 --> 00:42:56,5
We keep discovering new things.

346
00:42:56,86 --> 00:43:04,09
This year alone, we discovered and published, our taxonomists and partners,

347
00:43:04,09 --> 00:43:12,1
15 different new wasps which have never been described in anywhere in the world.

348
00:43:12,76 --> 00:43:18,79
And some of them, they are also beneficial because they feed on harmful insects.

349
00:43:20,07 --> 00:43:26,39
We have discovered, also, in Mbita, where we are going tomorrow,

350
00:43:27,44 --> 00:43:44,44
one of our scientists has discovered that there is a jumping spider that is attracted only to mosquitoes that are

351
00:43:44,45 --> 00:43:50,07
filled with human blood. So, and they jump and they feed on those insects.

352
00:43:50,51 --> 00:43:58,21
If you give them other insects, they wouldn't touch it. They go specifically for those type of mosquitoes.

353
00:43:58,67 --> 00:44:00,58
But they are, those mosquitoes,

354
00:44:02,55 --> 00:44:14,96
that specific jumping spider also requires a certain plant sugar source to sustain it also between its meals of

355
00:44:14,96 --> 00:44:19,39
mosquitoes, blood-filled mosquitoes. We call it vampire spider.

356
00:44:21,17 --> 00:44:27,8
So what it means is also that if you keep those type of plants in your habitat,

357
00:44:28,45 --> 00:44:31,73
you are going to manage also to keep equilibrium,

358
00:44:31,73 --> 00:44:36,22
also that you are maintaining the spiders that feed on your mosquitoes,

359
00:44:36,88 --> 00:44:46,08
that will be less mosquitoes to transmit malaria. So our world is not in black and white, it's not in boxes.

360
00:44:46,54 --> 00:44:48,04
It's all a continuum.

361
00:44:48,66 --> 00:44:57,92
So we have to manage it as a continuum, to make it very sustainable and very natural for the future.

362
00:44:58,12 --> 00:45:05,78
So if you cause imbalance by eliminating a certain type of insects from a certain type of plants,

363
00:45:07,63 --> 00:45:11,58
then you are causing an imbalance in your environment.

364
00:45:11,58 --> 00:45:16,19
Speaker 1: What would be the way to go for Africa in this respect?

365
00:45:16,55 --> 00:45:22,02
I mean, you have, let's say, the European agricultural system, or like the USA's doing it.

366
00:45:22,11 --> 00:45:25,76
Is that the way for Africa to go for, or, you're welcome to say-

367
00:45:25,76 --> 00:45:36,06
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is an excellent question, but also a complicated question. And so you can debate it either way.

368
00:45:37,26 --> 00:45:47,87
You can debate it either way because, one, so for example, generally,

369
00:45:47,87 --> 00:45:53,33
60% to 70% of the population in Africa is engaged in agriculture.

370
00:45:54,31 --> 00:46:01,59
I don't think that is a smart way, to keep that large proportion of your population in farming.

371
00:46:02,93 --> 00:46:10,81
So if you go to Europe, North America and Canada, you have about 4% or 5% of the population.

372
00:46:11,71 --> 00:46:22,33
So it is very inefficient to have 70% of your population to feed the rest. So this is not efficient way to do it.

373
00:46:23,03 --> 00:46:32,8
So we have to do it better. So, also, I think scientific technology alone is not going to do the trick.

374
00:46:34,02 --> 00:46:43,02
So we have to have the right policy. We have to have the right environment to do these things. Why do I say policy?

375
00:46:43,26 --> 00:46:54,17
Policy is important in this, because there has to be the right policy to land, and access to land, access to resources.

376
00:46:54,99 --> 00:46:56,8
So if you take a,

377
00:46:56,8 --> 00:47:06,00
Speaker 2: For example, many African countries, without mentioning any specific country, you have land,

378
00:47:07,57 --> 00:47:17,12
the farmer has to begin with very small land. So, they have, the farmer may have six, seven children. Farmer dies.

379
00:47:17,71 --> 00:47:27,62
The six, seven children split the land. So, neither one of them can make a living out of that small pieces of land.

380
00:47:28,57 --> 00:47:38,73
So we have to have a policy to stop fragmenting the land to small pieces, because you cannot make a living out of it.

381
00:47:38,98 --> 00:47:45,21
You cannot transform agriculture with small pieces. You cannot do a lot of different things also.

382
00:47:48,02 --> 00:47:52,06
So there has to be a policy also that is favorable to,

383
00:47:52,06 --> 00:48:03,81
Speaker 2: To enabling transformation of agriculture. We should be able to How this more was less.

384
00:48:05,01 --> 00:48:10,99
So and we have to make our agriculture is more efficient in utilization.

385
00:48:10,99 --> 00:48:23,11
And so also a large proportion of our farming system is rain fed. That's also not a sustainable way.

386
00:48:23,47 --> 00:48:31,96
To wait for rain waiting in the sky for a drop of water to drop, that's not a smart way to do.

387
00:48:32,35 --> 00:48:42,42
And only 4% of our land is, or the farmer land, is irrigated, and yet we have a lot of water flowing,

388
00:48:42,42 --> 00:48:45,81
you have a lot of also water being wasted also.

389
00:48:47,01 --> 00:48:57,2
So there's a lot of different things that we have to do to transform our farming system.

390
00:48:57,68 --> 00:49:07,42
So, having said that, I don't believe that one model alone is a the model for Africa.

391
00:49:09,14 --> 00:49:16,77
So it is not may not be of European model, but there are a lot of things we can borrow from, adapt from the European.

392
00:49:16,77 --> 00:49:25,02
A land policy, a access to these, so our efficiency in farming, and so on.

393
00:49:26,82 --> 00:49:35,76
So it's not a black and white concept I cannot give you that, yeah.

394
00:49:36,26 --> 00:49:44,8
But what I know is that we can not continue keeping a large population percentage of our population in farming,

395
00:49:45,17 --> 00:49:47,76
that's just not doable there, or sustainable.

396
00:49:47,76 --> 00:49:55,69
Speaker 1: Can you imagine a future where insect knowledge, knowledge about insects,

397
00:49:56,24 --> 00:49:58,93
will be sort of export products for Africa?

398
00:49:58,93 --> 00:50:03,85
Speaker 2: Yes, actually, yes. There are a-

399
00:50:03,85 --> 00:50:05,39
Speaker 1: Maybe you can repeat my question.

400
00:50:05,39 --> 00:50:07,4
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, okay.

401
00:50:07,4 --> 00:50:10,88
Speaker 1: What kind of future do insect have for-

402
00:50:10,88 --> 00:50:23,96
Speaker 2: Yeah, so can Africa use insects as export product? Yes, absolutely, I believe so.

403
00:50:24,94 --> 00:50:31,6
This is not actually even something for the long run, but it's already short term.

404
00:50:32,22 --> 00:50:46,69
There are companies that have already exploring to establish a plant here in Africa to produce mass rare insects for

405
00:50:46,98 --> 00:50:55,29
feed to Europe and somewhere else. So, yeah this is going to happen in the near future actually, yeah.

406
00:50:55,29 --> 00:51:04,6
Speaker 1: Maybe you can sort of give a compressed answer on how important insects are in terms of danger.

407
00:51:05,13 --> 00:51:11,06
Like what you said, there are many deaths caused by insects infectually,

408
00:51:11,39 --> 00:51:16,23
many more deaths by malaria than there are any other kind of.

409
00:51:16,23 --> 00:51:19,82
And there's also the beneficial things, so a little bit of compressed, kind of answer?

410
00:51:19,82 --> 00:51:23,32
Speaker 2: But repeated to what I said?

411
00:51:23,32 --> 00:51:24,32
Speaker 1: Yep.

412
00:51:24,32 --> 00:51:24,99
Speaker 2: Okay.

413
00:51:24,99 --> 00:51:37,05
Speaker 1: So if you would have to tell a nice story about what insects do mean for us, what would be your storyline?

414
00:51:37,05 --> 00:51:49,27
Speaker 2: Yeah, bees are very very important for humankind. So we have to protect bees without a doubt.

415
00:51:49,93 --> 00:52:01,87
So we have to make sure that they are healthy, and they live nicely, happily, and there are many ways to do that.

416
00:52:02,2 --> 00:52:12,42
So, and they need to have good pollen plant source and so on.

417
00:52:12,5 --> 00:52:17,35
So bees are number one, I think they are among the top which we need to do.

418
00:52:18,85 --> 00:52:23,66
Natural predators, predator insects are very important, as well.

419
00:52:23,66 --> 00:52:32,75
Predators that feed on harmful insects, that are harmful to people, to animals. Those are important, as well.

420
00:52:33,47 --> 00:52:41,57
So, but I think we have to also pay attention and try to eradicate

421
00:52:41,57 --> 00:52:54,8
or find a solution also to the myriad of major diseases that are transmitted by insects, mosquitos.

422
00:52:54,8 --> 00:53:09,11
Speaker 2: That transmit malaria, that transmit dengue, that transmit also a number of other disease both in animals

423
00:53:09,4 --> 00:53:16,66
and humans. Rift Valley fever and yellow fever and a number of other disease, those are important.

424
00:53:17,26 --> 00:53:21,98
For Africa, Tsetse fly, Tsetse flies are really critical.

425
00:53:23,1 --> 00:53:38,85
Many many fertile land in Africa has become abandoned by people because of the Tsetse fly infestation.

426
00:53:40,2 --> 00:53:41,7
So these also are very important.

427
00:53:42,13 --> 00:53:50,47
All of these things I have described the those are our focus for icipe, my organization, to do.

428
00:53:51,2 --> 00:53:57,15
So these are some of the important things I think. We work on ticks also.

429
00:53:57,15 --> 00:54:05,66
Ticks, and tick borne diseases, these are not just Africa problem, but this is a Europe, North America has a problem.

430
00:54:05,66 --> 00:54:12,96
And we have products in the pipeline, that are very effective, natural products from plants,

431
00:54:12,96 --> 00:54:14,91
from other microbes used in Africa.

432
00:54:15,69 --> 00:54:23,61
So I think the beauty of it is Africa has a lot of these problem, insect problem that also,

433
00:54:24,08 --> 00:54:27,84
a lot of also solutions also for controlling this.

434
00:54:27,92 --> 00:54:34,11
So for all these problems that I have indicated, like Tsetse flies, we have a product, for example,

435
00:54:34,33 --> 00:54:38,86
which came from wildlife, wild animals in Africa.

436
00:54:38,86 --> 00:54:45,73
Speaker 1: Somehow, I have the feeling that your institute has a lot of hidden treasures, I don't know,

437
00:54:45,73 --> 00:54:45,9
but that [CROSSTALK]

438
00:54:45,9 --> 00:54:49,25
Speaker 2: Yes, we do, yeah, absolutely, yes.

439
00:54:49,25 --> 00:54:50,07
Speaker 1: Can you repeat it?

440
00:54:50,07 --> 00:55:03,34
Speaker 2: Yeah, and icipe, I think, has a lot of important, unique treasures that are not widely known.

441
00:55:05,26 --> 00:55:15,9
But I think now also we are making a tremendous effort for the rest of the world to know what we are capable of doing,

442
00:55:16,08 --> 00:55:17,03
and what we have.

443
00:55:17,54 --> 00:55:27,48
So and I think also, I have to also indicate that icipe does, it also work with a lot of partners globally.

444
00:55:28,15 --> 00:55:37,66
So we have more than 300 partners in Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere,

445
00:55:38,22 --> 00:55:41,9
including the Netherlands we have a lot of partners, so yeah.

446
00:55:41,9 --> 00:55:45,19
Speaker 1: But how do you get this treasures yourself into the world?

447
00:55:45,19 --> 00:55:50,92
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is a critical writing, it's critical to scale out what we have,

448
00:55:51,12 --> 00:56:00,83
so that the rest of the planet can, and Africa can, make use of what we have at a faster rate.

449
00:56:01,29 --> 00:56:06,8
And that is a challenge, that's a big challenge Because a research organization is a research organization,

450
00:56:07,11 --> 00:56:17,67
and it's very difficult for a research organization to scale out and to reach out to a global forum, a global platform.

451
00:56:19,07 --> 00:56:25,19
And so partners become very important and funding becomes important, too.

452
00:56:25,41 --> 00:56:29,48
So funding, our funding, we are not a government organization,

453
00:56:29,8 --> 00:56:34,96
we are international organization that happen to be based in Kenya.

454
00:56:35,93 --> 00:56:47,84
So the funding comes from a lot of sources, so the European Union is among our largest investors, donors.

455
00:56:48,74 --> 00:56:55,02
The governments of Germany, of Sweden, of Switzerland and UK,

456
00:56:55,02 --> 00:57:01,87
many foundations they provide funding for us to make [INAUDIBLE] make a change.

457
00:57:02,13 --> 00:57:10,27
So all these resources I think have to be made available, not just for Africa,

458
00:57:10,48 --> 00:57:12,81
but for I think the rest of the planet as well.

459
00:57:12,93 --> 00:57:20,55
Because this is also, we are using the funds of the taxpayers of Europe and North America

460
00:57:20,56 --> 00:57:26,16
and so on also to generate these things, these products and find solution for constraints.

461
00:57:26,16 --> 00:57:36,38
Speaker 1: A totally other question, if you would have to describe your philosophy of life, what would it be?

462
00:57:36,38 --> 00:57:41,41
What do you look for yourself and humanity and the future?

463
00:57:41,41 --> 00:57:53,02
Speaker 2: Yeah, philosophy of life, I think for me, my motto personality is, and I tell my daughter also.

464
00:57:53,32 --> 00:57:59,95
I have one daughter, who is going to be a scientist also, she just joined a university in America, first year.

465
00:58:00,66 --> 00:58:06,72
So, my motto is live life with a purpose, not just for yourself,

466
00:58:06,72 --> 00:58:17,91
but really to contribute to changing lives for those people who are less fortunate than we are.

467
00:58:17,99 --> 00:58:24,22
And I think there are millions of people who don't have the skills or the resources that we have.

468
00:58:24,83 --> 00:58:31,34
So it will be a tragedy for any humankind to live for himself or herself.

469
00:58:31,99 --> 00:58:39,49
Like, if I have a good life myself, yeah the rest is like, okay.

470
00:58:40,13 --> 00:58:45,59
So I think we have to, if we see suffering of a fellow human being, we have to suffer together.

471
00:58:46,09 --> 00:58:56,59
We have to feel their pain. So, and I think if we have the mindset and the skills, we should do it.

472
00:58:56,85 --> 00:58:59,46
We should make use of it, yeah, certainly, yeah.

473
00:58:59,46 --> 00:59:02,93
Speaker 1: And can you say that science is changing,

474
00:59:04,19 --> 00:59:11,33
because our knowledge is spreading out quicker than ever around the planet, you see that?

475
00:59:11,33 --> 00:59:27,37
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, whether science is making a difference to the planet at a pace that we want,

476
00:59:28,28 --> 00:59:33,61
that is questionable, I don't have yes or no answer.

477
00:59:33,78 --> 00:59:41,12
However, I know that our lives have tremendously changed because of contributions of science.

478
00:59:41,73 --> 00:59:51,19
If you just back several decades back before the invention of antibiotics,

479
00:59:52,31 --> 01:00:02,81
before we had access to the first antibiotic, penicillin, which was accidentally discovered from a mold from a fungus.

480
01:00:02,81 --> 01:00:10,16
Speaker 2: Before that people were dying from very simple treatable things, from an infection.

481
01:00:10,16 --> 01:00:18,09
Speaker 2: So that's not the case any more.

482
01:00:19,26 --> 01:00:30,14
And then since the discovery of penicillin a lot of range of antibiotics were discovered from microbes, from plants,

483
01:00:30,37 --> 01:00:38,9
from other sources. So yes, science has made a tremendous difference for us.

484
01:00:39,43 --> 01:00:45,77
The vaccines, Polio is almost eradicated, so here and there only.

485
01:00:46,24 --> 01:00:54,77
Vaccines, people were dying from a lot of preventive disease, but the tragedy of it is even to this day,

486
01:00:54,77 --> 01:01:01,53
Speaker 2: Preventable diseases are still killing people in the developing world today.

487
01:01:01,53 --> 01:01:07,15
People are dying from infection, because they don't have access to simple antibiotics.

488
01:01:08,04 --> 01:01:11,66
Or they didn't have the means or the knowledge that [INAUDIBLE]

489
01:01:12,14 --> 01:01:20,84
if they vaccinate the kids at a certain age that they will prevent [INAUDIBLE] diseases.

490
01:01:20,95 --> 01:01:27,22
To this day, myself, I don't know what I have been vaccinated. I don't think I have been vaccinated when I was a kid.

491
01:01:28,4 --> 01:01:34,19
This is the world we live, the haves and the have-nots, and the gaps, so big difference, yeah?

492
01:01:34,19 --> 01:01:39,69
But, yes, science has made a tremendous, tremendous difference in our lives, yeah.

493
01:01:40,23 --> 01:01:45,53
And I think it will continue doing it, but I think governments have to value science.

494
01:01:47,54 --> 01:01:55,17
Not only in Africa, but globally, and do significant investment or so in science and technologies, so yeah.
