1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,1
Nicky: My name's Nicky Clayton

2
00:00:02,34 --> 00:00:09,37
and I'm professor of comparative cognition at the University of Cambridge in the Psychology department.

3
00:00:09,97 --> 00:00:15,25
I'm also a scientist in residence at Rambert, the dance company in London.

4
00:00:15,25 --> 00:00:15,81
Speaker 2: Rambert?

5
00:00:15,81 --> 00:00:16,73
Nicky: Rambert, yeah.

6
00:00:16,73 --> 00:00:17,65
Speaker 2: What is that?

7
00:00:17,65 --> 00:00:23,11
Nicky: It's the name, r-a-m-b-e-r, it was called Ballet Rambert, originally

8
00:00:23,12 --> 00:00:26,42
and then it became Rambert Dance Company And most recently,

9
00:00:26,82 --> 00:00:35,7
they changed the name again to just Rambert because it stands as an orchestra, and it's 90 years old this year.

10
00:00:35,9 --> 00:00:37,84
We've just celebrated our 90th birthday.

11
00:00:37,84 --> 00:00:43,43
Speaker 2: Okay, really, but you're a scientist in residence at a ballet company?

12
00:00:43,43 --> 00:00:47,86
Nicky: That's correct, yes. Well, ballet and contemporary dance, yes.

13
00:00:47,86 --> 00:00:51,02
Speaker 2: Why do they need a scientist? [LAUGH]

14
00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:52,04
Speaker 2: What's science do-

15
00:00:52,04 --> 00:01:00,22
Nicky: Well, I do various things but mainly I collaborate with Mark Baldwin, who's a world famous choreographer

16
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:02,46
and artistic director of the company.

17
00:01:02,83 --> 00:01:09,92
And we've worked on five choreographic works together, one about evolution called The Comedy of Change.

18
00:01:10,88 --> 00:01:18,05
One that was about crows and children and the power of play, called Sudden for Secret, Ever to be Told.

19
00:01:18,51 --> 00:01:22,65
One about sexual conflict, which was called What Was Ecstasy.

20
00:01:24,49 --> 00:01:26,04
So that's three of them,

21
00:01:26,04 --> 00:01:35,83
and most recent one that we’re doing which will premier shortly in July in fact called the creation based on Hayden's

22
00:01:35,83 --> 00:01:41,42
creation. It’s about the origin of life and the origin of time. It’s very movement based.

23
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:46,48
So that's some of the sorts of things that I do with my company

24
00:01:46,48 --> 00:01:50,36
and I also work with some of our dancers on their individual choreography.

25
00:01:50,36 --> 00:01:56,29
Speaker 2: Okay, so what's, why the emphasis on the signs or the event?

26
00:01:56,29 --> 00:02:05,99
Nicky: It's the integration of the two. It's about using ideas from science to inspire new choreographic works.

27
00:02:07,08 --> 00:02:09,65
So it's quite an interesting thing to do.

28
00:02:09,81 --> 00:02:16,13
And Clive Wilkins with whom I collaborate on the captured thought and dance tango.

29
00:02:16,78 --> 00:02:23,74
We wrote a paper together with another of my colleagues, Kevin Layland on the evolution of dance,

30
00:02:23,94 --> 00:02:29,31
which was published quite recently in Current Biology. So, all the work is interrelated.

31
00:02:29,31 --> 00:02:34,09
It is about, I suppose I am a movement junkie. I love to move.

32
00:02:34,27 --> 00:02:42,06
I love to dance and my science and art is really inspired by my love of dance and my love of birds,

33
00:02:42,06 --> 00:02:47,92
cuz I always wanted to be a bird. I've always wanted to fly and I have invisible wings.

34
00:02:47,92 --> 00:02:51,15
Speaker 2: I can see them. [LAUGH]

35
00:02:51,15 --> 00:02:52,8
Nicky: Yeah.

36
00:02:52,8 --> 00:02:59,22
Speaker 2: Let me go back to your professor at Cambridge University.

37
00:03:03,95 --> 00:03:12,73
Can you tell me what this exactly is, your Department. What do you teach?

38
00:03:12,73 --> 00:03:19,98
Nicky: Well, I'm based in a department of psychology these days, although my training, initially, was in zoology.

39
00:03:20,5 --> 00:03:23,13
So I read zoology at Oxford University.

40
00:03:23,37 --> 00:03:27,51
But I've always been interested in the interface between biology

41
00:03:27,55 --> 00:03:31,94
and psychology because I'm interested in how birds think.

42
00:03:32,52 --> 00:03:36,17
So the zoological aspect of it, is because of the birds,

43
00:03:36,76 --> 00:03:40,95
and the psychological aspect of it is that I'm interested in cognition.

44
00:03:41,19 --> 00:03:46,54
I'm interested in what's it like to think without words, as well as what it's like to think with words,

45
00:03:47,1 --> 00:03:53,47
which is something I explore scientifically in terms of the ability of birds in general,

46
00:03:53,75 --> 00:04:00,86
and members of the crow family in particular. They're at cognitive abilities, their problem solving.

47
00:04:00,86 --> 00:04:12,00
Speaker 2: Really, it's racing comes from zoology? [CROSSTALK] The other part from psychology.

48
00:04:12,00 --> 00:04:12,64
Nicky: Yeah.

49
00:04:12,64 --> 00:04:18,19
Speaker 2: And you combine it with trying to find out how birds can think.

50
00:04:18,19 --> 00:04:24,29
Nicky: Well, crows in particular, because crows are extremely intelligent. They've got huge brains for their body size.

51
00:04:24,43 --> 00:04:28,44
In fact, relative to body size their brains are as large as those of chimpanzees.

52
00:04:29,05 --> 00:04:33,82
And we know that they are extremely good problem solvers.

53
00:04:34,8 --> 00:04:44,07
The kinds of things that I've been investigating are whether these birds are capable of remembering the past

54
00:04:44,08 --> 00:04:45,64
and thinking about the future.

55
00:04:46,15 --> 00:04:50,53
So in other words, can they, lIke us, mentally travel backwards

56
00:04:50,54 --> 00:05:00,86
and forwards in time to remember specific past episodes and to imagine and crucially plan for future scenarios.

57
00:05:00,86 --> 00:05:13,32
Speaker 2: Okay, let me go back to define first what, in your opinion is and then, without thinking about birth,

58
00:05:15,21 --> 00:05:17,22
what do you think is thinking?

59
00:05:17,22 --> 00:05:26,37
Nicky: I would define cognition as the ability to problem solve.

60
00:05:26,85 --> 00:05:36,68
And it involves a series of skills, but the kinds of things that I want to include would be mental time travel

61
00:05:37,77 --> 00:05:46,3
and theory of mind. These two skills are related, so mental time travel is about being able to think about other times.

62
00:05:46,3 --> 00:05:49,94
So, times other than the here, and now, hence past, and future.

63
00:05:50,44 --> 00:05:54,08
And, theory of mind is the ability to think about other minds.

64
00:05:54,08 --> 00:06:02,87
So, if I have theory of mind, then I can understand that, your perspective will be similar to mine, in some regards,

65
00:06:03,36 --> 00:06:05,28
but in other ways, it will be crucially different.

66
00:06:06,02 --> 00:06:12,6
And the idea that I could put myself in your shoes, and imagine what you're thinking would be theory of mind.

67
00:06:12,71 --> 00:06:16,31
I think they're two important thinking skills.

68
00:06:16,31 --> 00:06:24,53
Speaker 2: They're thinking skills, but when you define what is thinking, what is thinking?

69
00:06:24,53 --> 00:06:27,2
Nicky: Well, as I've said, I think it's problem solving.

70
00:06:27,2 --> 00:06:30,48
Speaker 2: It's problem solving, and so what is a thought?

71
00:06:30,48 --> 00:06:35,83
Nicky: So, a thought is the ability to project the mind.

72
00:06:36,45 --> 00:06:42,5
So the problem with just defining it as problem solving is that I could say one problem I've got here is I'm thirsty.

73
00:06:43,14 --> 00:06:45,41
I want to pick up this cup to drink the water.

74
00:06:46,21 --> 00:06:53,34
Now, you could say that the ability to hold the cup and do this allows me to solve the problem of being thirsty.

75
00:06:53,9 --> 00:06:55,39
Well, that's a physical task.

76
00:06:55,89 --> 00:07:03,49
But the point about thinking is that you can play multiple scenarios in the mind without actually executing the task

77
00:07:03,49 --> 00:07:07,98
first. So I might have never encountered this kind of object before.

78
00:07:08,12 --> 00:07:16,83
Be able to think through in the mind's eye without taking any action what is the minimal amount of things I need to do

79
00:07:17,04 --> 00:07:20,93
in order to drink the water. So, for example with the birds.

80
00:07:21,36 --> 00:07:24,57
We have a water test that involves something similar to this.

81
00:07:24,68 --> 00:07:30,46
We call it the Aesop's Fable because it's based on the Aesop's Fable of The Thirsty Crow and The Pitcher.

82
00:07:31,26 --> 00:07:35,55
And in the fable of course, the crow encounters a pitcher of water.

83
00:07:35,91 --> 00:07:40,9
The water is too low, and so it's not within beak reach.

84
00:07:41,00 --> 00:07:43,58
And what the crow does is, she finds some stones

85
00:07:43,8 --> 00:07:49,22
and puts the stone into the pitcher to raise the water level to a level at which she can drink.

86
00:07:50,2 --> 00:07:55,58
So we can do something similar with our birds. We can present them with a tube that's got some water in.

87
00:07:55,83 --> 00:08:00,14
The water level is too low for the birds just to be able to go and reach the water.

88
00:08:00,46 --> 00:08:07,1
In fact, in our case, we don't make If the bird's thirsty we float a little tasty worm on top of the water.

89
00:08:07,43 --> 00:08:13,35
Waxworms and wax moth larvae, as they're properly called as a zoologist,

90
00:08:13,35 --> 00:08:18,4
are the Belgian truffles of the Corvidae world. They really, really love these.

91
00:08:18,55 --> 00:08:21,63
And so they're then highly motivated to get these worms.

92
00:08:21,83 --> 00:08:24,94
And of course the worms are hard to reach because the water level's too low.

93
00:08:25,86 --> 00:08:33,06
And the birds spontaneously put stones into the water level to raise the water.

94
00:08:33,97 --> 00:08:38,29
We can then use a task like that to, basic problem solving task, to ask, well,

95
00:08:38,61 --> 00:08:42,75
how are the birds thinking through this problem? How can they solve these things?

96
00:08:42,89 --> 00:08:48,43
So for example, we could have a series of tubes, only one of which contains water.

97
00:08:49,01 --> 00:08:55,61
Maybe in another condition, the worm is floating in air, thanks to a bit of [INAUDIBLE] rather than real magic.

98
00:08:56,07 --> 00:08:59,75
And in another one, the worm is resting on a solid, say sand,

99
00:09:00,32 --> 00:09:07,26
and we can ask whether the birds understand that there's no point putting stones into a tube full of air

100
00:09:07,7 --> 00:09:11,97
or a tube full of sand. That's not gonna change the level of the substrate.

101
00:09:12,25 --> 00:09:14,8
It's only going to work with the liquid, with the water.

102
00:09:15,3 --> 00:09:19,86
Similarly, we can give them the choice of different kinds of objects to put into the tube

103
00:09:20,05 --> 00:09:25,95
and ask whether they understand that it's heavy ones that sink, that are actually going to displace the water.

104
00:09:26,26 --> 00:09:32,71
And therefore allow the water level to rise to a level at which they can then reach the worm.

105
00:09:33,07 --> 00:09:38,98
Whereas if they put hollow ones in or ones that just float, that's not going to displace the water.

106
00:09:39,35 --> 00:09:44,17
So we can do various tests like that to see how they're thinking through the problem.

107
00:09:44,81 --> 00:09:51,53
And that's a way of trying to get it, how they can solve these problems and what they understand about the tasks.

108
00:09:51,53 --> 00:09:55,4
Speaker 2: Yeah, but now you are talking about the Corvidae family.

109
00:09:55,4 --> 00:10:00,67
Nicky: I'm talking about how the jays and rooks and [CROSSTALK] children.

110
00:10:00,67 --> 00:10:03,33
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll talk about that later.

111
00:10:03,33 --> 00:10:08,9
Nicky: Yeah but that's as an example. You asked me. There isn't a set definition up here.

112
00:10:09,00 --> 00:10:15,00
I can't give you full words that nails down what thinking is, because if I try and do that,

113
00:10:15,4 --> 00:10:17,7
there's going to be too many caveats to it.

114
00:10:17,7 --> 00:10:21,95
Speaker 2: Yeah, I understand. That's why I wanted you to think out loud, what it could possibly be.

115
00:10:21,95 --> 00:10:27,75
Nicky: So that's why I think problem solving, but one in which you can have sort of internal trial and error

116
00:10:27,76 --> 00:10:29,85
and think through a problem is key.

117
00:10:29,85 --> 00:10:32,6
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's interesting for me.

118
00:10:32,87 --> 00:10:36,67
First I would like to try to find out well, what's the area we are talking about?

119
00:10:37,15 --> 00:10:45,34
And after that I would like to talk with you about how do you do your research with crows and with children?

120
00:10:45,34 --> 00:10:48,04
Nicky: Yeah, so I think one difference you see-

121
00:10:48,04 --> 00:10:55,4
Speaker 2: Not everything about thinking and cognition is very clear to me because our audience is well educated,

122
00:10:55,68 --> 00:11:05,27
but they are not scientists. So that's why we're talking a little bit about what are we talking about.

123
00:11:05,27 --> 00:11:09,29
Nicky: Yes, well, the reason I gave problem solving is that

124
00:11:09,52 --> 00:11:12,91
but there are simple ways of problem solving that you wouldn't call thinking.

125
00:11:13,5 --> 00:11:16,6
Would be, you could imagine you just do something through trial and error.

126
00:11:16,79 --> 00:11:22,7
So you have no idea what this is, it's a novel object. And you push it this way, and that doesn't work.

127
00:11:22,7 --> 00:11:24,99
And you do that, and that doesn't work.

128
00:11:24,99 --> 00:11:30,65
And eventually, through exploring a number of things, you figure out that the best way to get the cup

129
00:11:30,66 --> 00:11:36,23
and drink is to do that action. And then they're after you, just to more of the same.

130
00:11:36,59 --> 00:11:42,88
Well, that's called learning by trial and error or instrumental conditioning is what the psychologists would call that.

131
00:11:43,33 --> 00:11:51,61
And most people wouldn't want to call any problem solving that simply occurred through learning by trial and error

132
00:11:51,61 --> 00:11:58,17
or instrumental conditioning cognition. They would want to say that cognition requires more than that.

133
00:11:58,34 --> 00:12:05,66
It's the ability to actually think through a problem without necessarily having to learn about the outcomes first.

134
00:12:05,98 --> 00:12:10,21
So that's why I've used that example as a distinction.

135
00:12:10,52 --> 00:12:16,52
So what you're usually looking for is to train your animal, your human subject,

136
00:12:16,86 --> 00:12:18,78
on a particular task until they're doing it.

137
00:12:19,43 --> 00:12:25,45
And then you use some kind of transfer test, in which really what you're tapping into is what have they understood,

138
00:12:26,3 --> 00:12:31,5
and how they do, simply more than just simple learning by rote.

139
00:12:31,95 --> 00:12:37,28
Can they abstract some sort of general rule that tells you that yes, they're actually thinking about it?

140
00:12:37,37 --> 00:12:40,07
They're just not automatically doing it.

141
00:12:40,07 --> 00:12:47,77
Speaker 2: Why are you so interested in this subject about how this works in your mind?

142
00:12:47,77 --> 00:12:54,83
Nicky: Well, I suppose I'm fascinated by thinking, per se.

143
00:12:55,3 --> 00:13:06,17
And at one level, I'm really interested in the different kinds of thought processes that go on

144
00:13:06,69 --> 00:13:11,13
and the extent to which they rely on words or don't rely on words.

145
00:13:11,92 --> 00:13:19,13
So I say words rather than language because, of course, in humans we have language.

146
00:13:20,13 --> 00:13:23,57
And sometimes we think without using words.

147
00:13:23,79 --> 00:13:29,82
But I wouldn't want to say that that's without language because it's not like you take bits of the brain that are

148
00:13:29,83 --> 00:13:34,18
responsible for language. And scraping them out of the brain and put on the side and carry on.

149
00:13:35,76 --> 00:13:42,41
All your linguistic skills contribute to all your thought processes, with and without words.

150
00:13:42,57 --> 00:13:50,58
But the whole idea that we might be able to get some to which words enrich our thoughts,

151
00:13:50,86 --> 00:13:58,44
but perhaps even more intriguingly the extent to which they can constrain our thoughts, I think is a fascinating area.

152
00:13:58,44 --> 00:14:04,35
Speaker 2: You meant, you expressed thinking in words?

153
00:14:04,35 --> 00:14:05,36
Nicky: Thinking without words.

154
00:14:05,36 --> 00:14:06,97
Speaker 2: Without words.

155
00:14:06,97 --> 00:14:07,62
Nicky: Yeah.

156
00:14:07,62 --> 00:14:09,15
Speaker 2: So what kinds of-

157
00:14:09,15 --> 00:14:10,32
Nicky: Well-

158
00:14:10,32 --> 00:14:11,03
Speaker 2: Ways of thinking are-

159
00:14:11,03 --> 00:14:20,9
Nicky: Contemporary dance, visual arts, are both examples of thinking without words or thinking largely without words.

160
00:14:21,14 --> 00:14:25,11
When you see a beautiful painting, it doesn't usually have words on it.

161
00:14:25,87 --> 00:14:30,88
And even if it does have a word on it, like the famous this is not a pipe,

162
00:14:31,98 --> 00:14:35,69
even then the point is so much more than just the words, right?

163
00:14:35,84 --> 00:14:46,56
And similarly in contemporary times, you see a beautiful series of movements, but words are really secondary.

164
00:14:47,42 --> 00:14:55,62
Yes, it's got a title, and yes, there might be a small description in the program, but the performance is so much more,

165
00:14:56,16 --> 00:14:59,98
or the original magic effect. That is also largely without words.

166
00:15:00,18 --> 00:15:04,93
I mean, the patter that goes with the effect is just a small part of the act.

167
00:15:04,96 --> 00:15:11,46
The bit that everybody goes aah is when something unexpected happens,

168
00:15:11,8 --> 00:15:16,54
when you realize that you can't possibly have seen what you thought you saw.

169
00:15:16,54 --> 00:15:25,77
And you must have not seen what really happened. So I'm interested in those juxtapositions.

170
00:15:25,77 --> 00:15:33,56
Speaker 2: A beautiful painting, you mean, the artist had a thought and he tried to express it in colors and-

171
00:15:33,56 --> 00:15:42,96
Nicky: Yes, yes, and the way in which you then wonder what the artist actually saw, what they actually thought,

172
00:15:43,47 --> 00:15:46,49
why they chose to represent it in that particular way.

173
00:15:46,49 --> 00:15:47,49
Speaker 2: Yeah.

174
00:15:47,49 --> 00:15:57,05
Nicky: And even with words, I mean, I think there's an interesting difference between scientific writing

175
00:15:57,78 --> 00:15:59,9
and literally artistic writing.

176
00:16:00,01 --> 00:16:04,43
Because in scientific writing You want to make everything as unambiguous as possible,

177
00:16:04,66 --> 00:16:08,94
because the whole point of a scientific paper is that, strictly speaking,

178
00:16:09,39 --> 00:16:12,44
anybody should be able to read the method section of the paper.

179
00:16:13,3 --> 00:16:19,17
And if they have the right skills and facilities, they should be able to replicate the findings.

180
00:16:19,17 --> 00:16:26,7
So, in a scientific paper, you want to make everything as unambiguous and clear as possible.

181
00:16:27,05 --> 00:16:33,4
But very often in literary writing, you want to make it ambiguous cuz you want layers to it.

182
00:16:33,72 --> 00:16:43,23
You want the words not to be self-explanatory, but to generate new thoughts. I think that is an interesting contrast.

183
00:16:43,5 --> 00:16:48,3
So, in a way, I think in really good literature,

184
00:16:49,22 --> 00:16:58,58
the words are almost being used in the way notes are used by a composer to create a beautiful story.

185
00:16:58,93 --> 00:17:07,66
To build rich layers of atmosphere, much of which is largely wordless, right?

186
00:17:07,66 --> 00:17:15,35
I mean, you can have labels for emotions, but there's so much more to love, or joy, or sorrow,

187
00:17:15,35 --> 00:17:18,13
than there is to just the label of it.

188
00:17:19,57 --> 00:17:27,75
In the same way as when you see a beautiful piece of art, you hear a goodish piece of music, all these feelings

189
00:17:27,79 --> 00:17:36,14
and thoughts swell up inside you, but the words are only secondary, right?

190
00:17:37,15 --> 00:17:44,86
There's a subjective experience going on inside the mind of the viewer, or listener, or both.

191
00:17:44,86 --> 00:17:47,65
Speaker 2: And it's a thought, you think?

192
00:17:47,65 --> 00:17:54,05
Is it a thought if you see a beautiful painting, or a beautiful dance, or a beautiful- Yes, I think they're thoughts.

193
00:17:54,05 --> 00:17:59,09
Nicky: Heavily charged emotional thoughts often, but- Conscious thoughts?

194
00:18:00,48 --> 00:18:03,76
I think they canbe conscious, and I think they can be unconscious, right?

195
00:18:03,79 --> 00:18:09,24
You can have that unconscious feeling of just, isn't this wonderful,

196
00:18:09,97 --> 00:18:13,53
and then you can actually have real conscious things.

197
00:18:13,68 --> 00:18:19,87
So, when you were talking earlier about the timing of the story telling,

198
00:18:20,31 --> 00:18:28,83
if some sort of dramatic music comes at the wrong time and the experience, you're suddenly very conscious of it, right?

199
00:18:29,01 --> 00:18:36,34
All of a sudden, skeptical thoughts come into your head where you think, mm, that's not right, or I don't believe that.

200
00:18:36,92 --> 00:18:44,21
Or you see a bit of a film sequence and it's out of sync, and you go, they stuffed up there, didn't they?

201
00:18:44,59 --> 00:18:50,74
And all of a sudden, those things that perhaps were beforehand just sorta punches, you were enjoying it

202
00:18:50,75 --> 00:18:58,61
but not really questioning your thoughts, all of a sudden, it's like a switch, and suddenly you think, hang on a minute.

203
00:18:58,94 --> 00:19:07,95
Or you're listening to, I don't know, political politicians speaking, and all of a sudden you think, you shifty nettle,

204
00:19:08,35 --> 00:19:10,43
I don't believe you for one minute.

205
00:19:10,43 --> 00:19:22,00
Or I can listen to the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough, and I find myself just believing every word he says.

206
00:19:22,23 --> 00:19:28,18
Because he has that kind of a voice where if he said, Nicki, darling, please jump off a cliff right now

207
00:19:28,19 --> 00:19:34,49
and commit suicide, I'd be halfway there before I was even realizing it, because he's got such a persuasive voice.

208
00:19:35,47 --> 00:19:42,52
So you have that constant flip-flopping, I think, between the conscious experience and the unconscious one.

209
00:19:42,52 --> 00:19:46,11
I mean, a classic case to me is when Clive and I are dancing tango.

210
00:19:46,91 --> 00:19:56,4
If you were to say to me afterwards, what steps did you dance, or show me that move again, I wouldn't remember,

211
00:19:56,89 --> 00:20:04,83
because when we're dancing we're in flow. Which is connected together, moving as one to the music.

212
00:20:04,83 --> 00:20:13,97
So I'm not thinking, he wants me to do a backward upturn now, or a gown show-up. My brain doesn't work that way.

213
00:20:14,52 --> 00:20:23,53
I'm just subconsciously just connecting with Clive and just moving together as one, and synchronating to the music.

214
00:20:23,91 --> 00:20:27,01
I'm not thinking about the moves.

215
00:20:29,85 --> 00:20:36,23
And obviously, that's particularly the case in something like tango, where it's such a connected and improvised dance.

216
00:20:36,65 --> 00:20:45,69
But even in choreographic sequences, often you will hear the rehearsal director saying to one of the dancers,

217
00:20:45,97 --> 00:20:47,49
don't over think it.

218
00:20:48,08 --> 00:20:56,42
Because if you put to much conscious thought, conscious cognition into the process, you will ruin the fluidity

219
00:20:56,42 --> 00:20:57,85
and the naturalness of the music.

220
00:20:57,99 --> 00:21:04,65
So, it was always an interesting juxtaposition there between the conscious and the unconscious thoughts.

221
00:21:04,65 --> 00:21:13,72
Speaker 2: That's very, very interesting, and maybe you can talk about that a little bit later,

222
00:21:14,74 --> 00:21:24,31
because I would like to know, because I just need to know, how do you do your research about thinking?

223
00:21:25,66 --> 00:21:28,61
Because, our viewer doesn't know anything.

224
00:21:28,61 --> 00:21:39,06
So, now, in this part, I would like to feel the surprise that your researched crows. Do you understand?

225
00:21:39,06 --> 00:21:48,11
Nicky: So you mean, you'd like me to talk about an experiment that was surprising?

226
00:21:48,11 --> 00:21:56,22
Speaker 2: Not that, but for our viewers, you researched our mind, about thinking,

227
00:21:57,38 --> 00:21:59,46
but our viewers don't know that you researched crows.

228
00:21:59,46 --> 00:22:01,13
Nicky: Crows, okay.

229
00:22:01,13 --> 00:22:05,42
Speaker 2: So, well, I'll ask you how do you do your research?

230
00:22:05,42 --> 00:22:07,91
Nicky: You want me to start with I work with crows.

231
00:22:07,91 --> 00:22:11,53
Speaker 2: Yeah, for example, yeah, yeah, yeah.

232
00:22:11,53 --> 00:22:12,43
Nicky: Okay.

233
00:22:12,43 --> 00:22:23,31
Nicky: So, I suppose one way to define thoughts would be that I'm interested in studying the mental lives.

234
00:22:24,33 --> 00:22:33,7
And that it's mental movements, I suppose, it's what's going on in the mind that I'm interested in.

235
00:22:34,53 --> 00:22:46,32
And I work mainly with humans and with crows. And you might think, well, why crows?

236
00:22:46,32 --> 00:22:52,83
Surely, monkeys I could understand, but why a crow? Well, crows are extremely intelligent.

237
00:22:53,98 --> 00:22:58,99
They have huge brains to the body size. They're as big as chimpanzees.

238
00:23:00,23 --> 00:23:05,69
In fact, my husband is calling them feathered apes when it comes to their mental abilities,

239
00:23:05,96 --> 00:23:20,49
because they're so cognitively impressive. And they're very observant and very good problem solvers.

240
00:23:22,09 --> 00:23:31,8
So the way in which we do the experiments are to give them a series of problem-solving puzzles, if you like,

241
00:23:32,69 --> 00:23:42,66
with a view to trying to systematically vary certain parameters, in order to try to get a handle on they're thinking,

242
00:23:43,1 --> 00:23:44,37
how they're solving a particular-

243
00:23:44,37 --> 00:23:45,47
Speaker 2: And do crows think?

244
00:23:45,47 --> 00:23:46,81
Nicky: Definitely.

245
00:23:46,81 --> 00:23:49,61
Speaker 2: How do you know? How do you know that crows think?

246
00:23:49,61 --> 00:23:56,32
Nicky: Well, because we can show that they're so good at solving these problems.

247
00:23:57,33 --> 00:24:02,68
They can think about the past and the future, for example. We've been able to show in.

248
00:24:03,45 --> 00:24:05,9
One experiment that they are capable.

249
00:24:05,9 --> 00:24:06,71
Speaker 2: Do they have memories?

250
00:24:06,71 --> 00:24:09,34
Nicky: They have fantastic memories, yeah.

251
00:24:09,88 --> 00:24:18,32
So, your Clark's nutcracker, which is an American Corvid that lives Yosemite high up in the mountains,

252
00:24:19,09 --> 00:24:23,6
hides on average about 30,000 seeds a year.

253
00:24:24,55 --> 00:24:30,11
And can remember the location of these 30,000 caches

254
00:24:31,73 --> 00:24:37,39
and people have tested their memories over a periods of nine months and found no evidence of forgetting.

255
00:24:38,22 --> 00:24:44,94
So, they have really remarkable memories of where they have hidden their stashes.

256
00:24:44,94 --> 00:24:46,93
Speaker 2: They remember 30,000.

257
00:24:46,93 --> 00:24:47,28
Nicky: Yeah.

258
00:24:47,28 --> 00:24:47,76
Speaker 2: It's false.

259
00:24:47,76 --> 00:24:48,11
Nicky: Yeah.

260
00:24:48,11 --> 00:24:48,59
Speaker 2: Where they.

261
00:24:48,59 --> 00:24:48,95
Nicky: Yeah.

262
00:24:48,95 --> 00:24:49,54
Speaker 2: Put their seeds.

263
00:24:49,54 --> 00:24:55,9
Nicky: Yeah, so they've got fantastic memories, and caching, the ability to hide food,

264
00:24:56,36 --> 00:25:03,84
is a very interesting behavior from looking at aspects of cognition Because you can ask it how good are there memories

265
00:25:03,88 --> 00:25:08,17
and you can show that if you remove the seeds, so they couldn't possibly be using smell,

266
00:25:08,68 --> 00:25:10,79
they still go back to those particular places.

267
00:25:11,64 --> 00:25:15,2
We've been able to show that they don't just remember where the food is hidden.

268
00:25:15,55 --> 00:25:22,39
They can remember which kinds of food were hidden where and how long ago, so they can remember what happened where

269
00:25:22,4 --> 00:25:23,24
and when.

270
00:25:24,63 --> 00:25:31,58
We've been able to show that they can even remember which particular individuals were watching when they hid the food,

271
00:25:31,91 --> 00:25:35,92
and then they'll come back later and move those foods to new hiding places.

272
00:25:36,52 --> 00:25:40,94
Which the potential themes, by definition, don't know about the new hiding places.

273
00:25:41,58 --> 00:25:45,77
We've shown that when it comes to social awareness,

274
00:25:46,29 --> 00:25:52,45
they go to great lengths to protect their hidden food from being stolen by others.

275
00:25:52,69 --> 00:26:03,19
So for example, we've been able to show that if other birds are watching, not only do they move them to new places

276
00:26:03,19 --> 00:26:04,54
when the other birds have come back.

277
00:26:05,2 --> 00:26:12,27
But they will also specifically hide the food in shady spots rather then well lit places,

278
00:26:12,56 --> 00:26:19,96
which is much harder for the onlooker to see. And in fact the way we discovered that was we had a BBC1 film crew come.

279
00:26:20,49 --> 00:26:23,76
They were filming for a series called Child of Our Time.

280
00:26:24,91 --> 00:26:34,22
And the cameraman got very frustrated because Sweetie Pie, who was a very tame, beautiful scrub jay would wait

281
00:26:34,23 --> 00:26:39,7
and only had food every time the cameraman had to take a toilet break.

282
00:26:41,06 --> 00:26:47,78
And eventually I had to say to the cameraman look away and I'll tell you when to start recording.

283
00:26:48,83 --> 00:26:50,51
And that was the only way we could film her.

284
00:26:50,72 --> 00:26:58,79
And then we noticed that she was only hiding in the places in the arena that weren't well lit.

285
00:26:59,14 --> 00:27:05,7
And that gave us the idea to actually test, was she specifically choosing shady places when observers were present?

286
00:27:05,95 --> 00:27:14,22
And we found that, sure enough, if another bird or a human was looking, she would selectively cache in the shady spots.

287
00:27:15,17 --> 00:27:17,05
And so would all the other birds we tested.

288
00:27:17,51 --> 00:27:22,37
Whereas, if she was caching in private, she was happy to cache in sunny and shady spots.

289
00:27:22,84 --> 00:27:30,18
We've even shown that these kind of cache protection tactics that the birds do, so moving the caches,

290
00:27:30,72 --> 00:27:37,31
hiding in shady spots and so on and so forth. That they're only done by experienced birds.

291
00:27:37,54 --> 00:27:41,05
Naive birds who've had no experience with stealing caches don't do it.

292
00:27:41,13 --> 00:27:49,15
So it's not just a hard wired instinctive ability. More evidence that it's theory of mind.

293
00:27:49,51 --> 00:27:53,98
Once you've had the experience of stealing yourself you can put yourselves in another's shoes

294
00:27:53,99 --> 00:27:58,7
and go well if I was that bird I would be watching where those caches were.

295
00:27:58,74 --> 00:28:02,22
And I'd come back and steal them so I better move them to new places.

296
00:28:02,68 --> 00:28:08,29
But they only engage in those tactics when they themselves have been thieves. It's really quite impressive.

297
00:28:08,29 --> 00:28:15,22
Speaker 2: But that sounds very interesting and you convinced me of those crows being very smart,

298
00:28:16,01 --> 00:28:22,98
or of capable of thinking, of solving problems. What are you interested in?

299
00:28:23,95 --> 00:28:34,33
In how crows record family things or do you, in the end, want to find out how we think?

300
00:28:34,33 --> 00:28:36,18
Nicky: Both. Both.

301
00:28:36,6 --> 00:28:42,62
So, I would argue in the same way as if you want to know how a computer works,

302
00:28:43,32 --> 00:28:45,54
you wouldn't want to only use an Apple Mac.

303
00:28:45,85 --> 00:28:53,00
You'd want to also look at how a PC works and see the similarities and differences in your types of computer.

304
00:28:53,48 --> 00:28:56,92
In order to have a better understanding of how computers work.

305
00:28:57,53 --> 00:29:01,91
In the same way I'm gonna to have a better understanding, I think,

306
00:29:02,7 --> 00:29:10,61
about how our brains work if I look at similarities and differences between crows and people.

307
00:29:10,95 --> 00:29:19,68
Because crows are very distantly related to us, we share a common ancestor with them over 300 million years ago.

308
00:29:19,68 --> 00:29:27,55
Well, we as humans, we as mammals, it depends how you want to look at it, but birds

309
00:29:27,55 --> 00:29:30,9
and mammals had a common ancestor over 300 million years ago.

310
00:29:31,02 --> 00:29:35,31
So there's been a long time in our evolutionary history in which we've been diverging,

311
00:29:35,69 --> 00:29:42,94
we've been going down different paths. And our brains and those of other mammals are layered.

312
00:29:43,14 --> 00:29:49,52
So our cortex has six layers to it, whereas the bird brain doesn't have layers, it's nucleated.

313
00:29:49,92 --> 00:29:55,86
So the analogy might be that a bird brain on a mammalian brain or a human brain,

314
00:29:55,86 --> 00:30:01,26
they're both full of these nerve cells that are so important for thinking processes.

315
00:30:01,77 --> 00:30:08,18
And my analogy would be, if I imagine cakes, the bird brain is like a fruit cake,

316
00:30:08,61 --> 00:30:12,9
and the mammalian brain is like a six-layered Austrian chocolate cake, the Sachertorte.

317
00:30:13,46 --> 00:30:20,06
So they're both made of cake mix, but the structure or the layout, the architecture, is actually quite different.

318
00:30:20,52 --> 00:30:29,06
So that then raises interesting questions about whether those different neuro-architectures might impose different

319
00:30:29,07 --> 00:30:30,97
constraints on our thinking pattern.

320
00:30:30,97 --> 00:30:38,08
Speaker 2: Well, what did you learn from the crows, so far?

321
00:30:38,08 --> 00:30:45,92
Nicky: Well, many things. So firstly, we've learnt that they have really sophisticated cognitive abilities.

322
00:30:46,17 --> 00:30:50,47
So there are a number of things that were thought to be unique to human beings.

323
00:30:50,71 --> 00:30:57,38
So at one time it was said that tool manufacture is uniquely human and then they discovered that well, no,

324
00:30:57,38 --> 00:30:57,95
chimps use tools.

325
00:30:58,53 --> 00:31:07,22
We've now found that all the crows that we've tested, all the different species, will happily use tools

326
00:31:07,23 --> 00:31:11,05
and even make them even though they don't necessarily use tools in the wild.

327
00:31:11,05 --> 00:31:21,73
So New Caledonian crows rely heavily on tools to find food in the wild but mocks and jays don't but they will use

328
00:31:21,74 --> 00:31:26,83
and make tools in the lab if they're given a task that requires one.

329
00:31:26,83 --> 00:31:30,7
Speaker 2: Also you can stimulate the thinking process.

330
00:31:30,7 --> 00:31:35,65
Nicky: Yes, so normally a rook has a very long bill,

331
00:31:36,06 --> 00:31:41,7
and the kinds of foods that they eat are usually things like earthworms in the soil.

332
00:31:41,9 --> 00:31:47,38
So for that you don't need a tool, you just need to insert your beak deep into the soil.

333
00:31:47,72 --> 00:31:54,76
And they have bare patches around their faces, which are probably an adaptation for being able to dig the earthworms

334
00:31:54,76 --> 00:31:58,77
and the other grubs that are in the soil. But for that you don't need a tool.

335
00:31:58,77 --> 00:32:05,86
But, if you give them a task in the Lab where they will need a tool in order to reach the food.

336
00:32:06,29 --> 00:32:09,36
They will happily use tools, make tools.

337
00:32:09,36 --> 00:32:14,29
Speaker 2: Can we see them? Do you have any proof or evidence?

338
00:32:14,29 --> 00:32:20,6
Nicky: I can show you some video footage of spontaneously taking a piece of wire

339
00:32:21,04 --> 00:32:25,4
and bending it into a hook to retrieve a bucket that's out of it's reach.

340
00:32:25,4 --> 00:32:32,83
And I can show you rooks and jays using stones and other objects to raise the water level to get worms.

341
00:32:32,83 --> 00:32:36,12
Speaker 2: The Belgian Truffle?

342
00:32:36,12 --> 00:32:40,24
Nicky: The Belgian Truffle. So we've got a lot of video footage

343
00:32:40,24 --> 00:32:40,55
Speaker 2: Great.

344
00:32:40,55 --> 00:32:45,19
Nicky: We can show you all that tomorrow and you can have copies of anything you'd like.

345
00:32:45,19 --> 00:32:50,5
Speaker 2: Great. So how do we as humans, our species, benefit from what you learned from crows?

346
00:32:50,5 --> 00:32:54,75
Nicky: How do we benefit?

347
00:32:57,21 --> 00:33:07,96
Well, I think people are fascinated by animals and a lot of people would love to go far away

348
00:33:08,15 --> 00:33:16,44
and see chimpanzees in the wild, making tools and interacting. And we all love the footage.

349
00:33:17,83 --> 00:33:26,24
The whole idea that these feathered apes are actually in the back garden is pretty stunning, I think,

350
00:33:26,38 --> 00:33:30,61
in that you could actually watch them solving problems in action.

351
00:33:31,33 --> 00:33:37,45
And it's not just tool use, that was one thing that was viewed as uniquely human. We now know it's not.

352
00:33:38,24 --> 00:33:40,22
And why is that interesting?

353
00:33:40,52 --> 00:33:45,22
Well, it's one of a number of things that we thought was, perhaps,

354
00:33:45,23 --> 00:33:51,75
responsible for how we've come to get our sophisticated cognitive abilities.

355
00:33:52,33 --> 00:33:57,00
But, if these birds have it too then we are not unique.

356
00:33:57,24 --> 00:34:02,2
So either that means that a lot more animals out there have it than we thought

357
00:34:02,64 --> 00:34:05,36
or it means that only a select few have it

358
00:34:05,72 --> 00:34:12,91
and in which case probably these abilities have evolved in very different animals with very different brains,

359
00:34:13,36 --> 00:34:19,7
but probably for a similar reason. That raises a question of what is that similar reason.

360
00:34:19,89 --> 00:34:29,26
Is it because of needing to be innovative problem solvers and therefore to be able to make tours if we need them,

361
00:34:30,06 --> 00:34:33,22
or is it because of complex social lives?

362
00:34:33,45 --> 00:34:46,55
The fact that we form long term relationships with others that we are very good at being able to detect who's honest,

363
00:34:46,81 --> 00:34:47,59
and who's cheating.

364
00:34:48,33 --> 00:34:57,55
We're able to form alliances and political maneuvers to strengthen our own chance of overcoming our enemies.

365
00:34:58,05 --> 00:34:59,99
Politics is a good example of that.

366
00:35:00,45 --> 00:35:08,53
We know that the chimpanzees form complex relationships, alliances and can do these kind of primate politics.

367
00:35:09,17 --> 00:35:16,5
More recently we discovered that these corvins, these members of the crow family, like the rooks and the ravens

368
00:35:16,51 --> 00:35:24,24
and the jays can do that, form these complex social relationships too. So I think it raises-

369
00:35:24,24 --> 00:35:30,09
Speaker 2: Like can you give examples? The social relations were you prepared to use?

370
00:35:30,09 --> 00:35:31,41
Can they fall in love, for example?

371
00:35:31,41 --> 00:35:37,44
Nicky: Well, they pair for life, that's for sure. I've been very worried when one night.

372
00:35:37,45 --> 00:35:44,89
I remember when two of our jackdaws, you'll like this because the jackdaws were named after ethologists.

373
00:35:45,39 --> 00:35:49,49
So we have Niko Tinbergen [LAUGH] and Konrad Lorenz.

374
00:35:50,57 --> 00:35:57,66
And when Konrad Lorenz died, the jackdaw Conrad Lorenz, as opposed to the human Konrad Lorenz,

375
00:35:57,66 --> 00:36:05,8
Niko was absolutely devastated and just stopped eating and hardly moved for about a week.

376
00:36:05,95 --> 00:36:08,69
And I was really worried we were going to lose him.

377
00:36:09,55 --> 00:36:18,8
Eventually he was all right, but it looked to me like emotional devastation,

378
00:36:18,87 --> 00:36:24,94
course it's very difficult to know exactly how you would say whether another bird was in love

379
00:36:24,98 --> 00:36:31,5
but certainly in terms of their behavior it was consistent with being in love and then being bereft,

380
00:36:31,5 --> 00:36:40,3
but they usually pair for life. So they form these very stable, long term, monogamous relationships.

381
00:36:40,3 --> 00:36:44,39
Speaker 2: Is it also an evolutionary process that they pair for life?

382
00:36:44,39 --> 00:36:51,66
Nicky: Well certainly in things like jackdraws it's very important if you're to defend a nest cavity

383
00:36:52,03 --> 00:36:59,52
and have offspring, it takes two. And a lone jackdraw is right down the bottom of the pecking order.

384
00:36:59,75 --> 00:37:06,61
So you don't want to just find a mate, produce young, and then go off and find another one when you need them.

385
00:37:06,61 --> 00:37:09,49
You really need to stay as a couple.

386
00:37:10,3 --> 00:37:16,15
We also know in the jays, for example, that during the breeding season the male will feed the female.

387
00:37:17,1 --> 00:37:20,32
This courtship feeding is very common in a number of birds.

388
00:37:21,06 --> 00:37:26,19
It's just that in the jays they do it very delicately which means that we can actually see,

389
00:37:26,47 --> 00:37:31,78
and I can show you footage of this, what the male feeds the female.

390
00:37:32,58 --> 00:37:38,21
So we can actually see the items being physically transferred from his beak to her beak.

391
00:37:38,9 --> 00:37:43,23
So we can count what kinds of food and how many, so we can quantify the food sharing.

392
00:37:43,64 --> 00:37:54,44
And what we've been able to show is is series of experiments is that the male jay is able to feed the female what she

393
00:37:54,57 --> 00:37:57,86
wants even if that's quite different to what he wants.

394
00:37:58,15 --> 00:38:05,24
So, for example, if I've just seen you eat a whole box of chocolates, Alex,

395
00:38:05,56 --> 00:38:07,33
and then you've maybe left a couple at the end.

396
00:38:07,43 --> 00:38:12,21
So I'm pretty sure you're full of chocolate, even though I like chocolate,

397
00:38:12,78 --> 00:38:18,6
I could infer that you're done with the chocolates now, you're probably going to want something different to eat.

398
00:38:18,76 --> 00:38:21,22
Well the jays can also do that.

399
00:38:21,33 --> 00:38:27,91
They can ignore their own desire of what they want in order to cater for what their female wants.

400
00:38:27,91 --> 00:38:41,76
Speaker 2: Can you say that thinking is a evolutionary process, so if it develops in the crow's mind or crow's brain,

401
00:38:46,84 --> 00:38:55,65
can you say that our own thinking is developing as well? Can you develop thinking?

402
00:38:55,65 --> 00:39:00,7
Nicky: Yes, I mean, you know, young children are not very good at certain aspects of thinking.

403
00:39:01,03 --> 00:39:02,12
So for example,

404
00:39:02,66 --> 00:39:09,59
children before the age of four don't understand what a lie is because they can't understand that your point of view

405
00:39:09,59 --> 00:39:11,45
could be different from my point of view.

406
00:39:12,21 --> 00:39:18,75
So there's a famous task called the Sally-Anne task which we'll demonstrate for you tomorrow that illustrates this,

407
00:39:18,75 --> 00:39:20,48
where you ask a little child.

408
00:39:21,21 --> 00:39:28,3
Say there's one dolly that has seen an item being hidden in one box and then that dolly goes out of the room.

409
00:39:28,74 --> 00:39:37,56
And then the food is then moved from that box to a new box, the little child won't understand that Sally,

410
00:39:37,56 --> 00:39:44,25
who'd left the room, doesn't know that the toy was moved here because all Sally saw was it go in the first box.

411
00:39:44,67 --> 00:39:52,5
The little child, well she, Sally knows just what she knows, which is that the toy is now in this box not in that box.

412
00:39:53,12 --> 00:39:59,66
And similarly, young children don't have a concept of yesterday and tomorrow.

413
00:40:00,01 --> 00:40:04,67
Neither of those things, the ability to think about other minds. And to think about other times.

414
00:40:05,72 --> 00:40:09,59
Those two things don't develop until children reach about the age of four.

415
00:40:09,59 --> 00:40:17,39
Speaker 2: But I mean of course in people's lives, thinking develops.

416
00:40:17,79 --> 00:40:26,7
But I mean for our species does the thinking develop, say in one out of 1000 years, or in a million years,

417
00:40:27,89 --> 00:40:31,43
do we have developed another kind of thinking? [INAUDIBLE]

418
00:40:31,43 --> 00:40:37,2
Nicky: Well, that's an interesting question, isn't it? The extent to which our thinking changes.

419
00:40:38,73 --> 00:40:49,65
At one level, you could sort of say our brains haven't really changed much since beginning of humans, if you like.

420
00:40:49,81 --> 00:40:57,51
And so there's probably a sense in which we're not any more intelligent now than we were.

421
00:40:57,64 --> 00:41:00,36
Well I'm going to give you two alternative arguments.

422
00:41:00,36 --> 00:41:09,16
Okay, so the one case would be our brains haven't changed, so probably at least since our ability to read and write,

423
00:41:09,65 --> 00:41:16,16
our thinking skills haven't improved. We're probably no more or less intelligent than we were then.

424
00:41:17,03 --> 00:41:26,28
The other line of argument would be to say, well I don't know whether our intelligence, per se, has changed.

425
00:41:26,8 --> 00:41:30,37
But our thinking patterns may well have done.

426
00:41:30,37 --> 00:41:37,3
The whole notion that we live in a digital age, what has that done to our brains?

427
00:41:37,53 --> 00:41:42,24
So most people, I think don't tend to remember telephone numbers any more.

428
00:41:42,4 --> 00:41:46,92
You just pick up your mobile phone and hit your search list and press the button.

429
00:41:49,86 --> 00:41:52,57
We have computers and iPhones

430
00:41:53,35 --> 00:42:02,55
and iPads that allow us to record information in ways which I think is fundamentally changing how we think.

431
00:42:02,74 --> 00:42:09,46
I'll give you just one example in an area that I happen to know about, which of course is dance,

432
00:42:09,86 --> 00:42:22,26
and in both contemporary dance and in ballet, when you develop a new choreographic work.

433
00:42:23,52 --> 00:42:32,3
In the olden days, everything used to be written down through particular notation, [INAUDIBLE] notation.

434
00:42:33,11 --> 00:42:40,18
And of course there was a bit of ambiguity when you come to reinterpret the story.

435
00:42:40,27 --> 00:42:46,88
If you go back and look at the original [INAUDIBLE] and you want to make a new production,

436
00:42:46,88 --> 00:42:56,04
as did in 2012,and you want to stick as closely to what you think was meant by the original terminology.

437
00:42:56,89 --> 00:43:02,34
It's all a series of notations, which describe the basic moods, but, obviously,

438
00:43:02,35 --> 00:43:09,38
there's going to be some ambiguity in what those things mean, in the same way as if you were a film maker.

439
00:43:10,2 --> 00:43:16,01
And you want to develop a new version of a particular series based on book.

440
00:43:16,7 --> 00:43:22,24
Of course there's the information in the book, but then there's the layers on top of that that need interpreting.

441
00:43:23,6 --> 00:43:29,34
But of course these days in dance, what most choreographers do, Is to record it.

442
00:43:29,34 --> 00:43:41,37
Now, you don't have that same level of interpretation, you just watch the video footage of the piece.

443
00:43:41,61 --> 00:43:45,98
So that's a way in which our thinking probably has changed.

444
00:43:46,56 --> 00:43:48,83
There are a lot of people, it's not my area,

445
00:43:48,83 --> 00:43:54,12
but there are a lot of people obviously studying things like how Twitter and Facebook

446
00:43:54,16 --> 00:44:04,04
and those forms of social media are affecting the way in which our social interactions work. So I-

447
00:44:04,04 --> 00:44:09,49
Speaker 2: But can you say that if our thinking develops

448
00:44:09,53 --> 00:44:12,85
and I mean in the future we will develop another way of thinking-

449
00:44:12,85 --> 00:44:16,41
Nicky: Well that's really exciting question, I think.

450
00:44:16,41 --> 00:44:17,09
Speaker 2: What is?

451
00:44:17,09 --> 00:44:25,75
Nicky: Well the question of whether by understanding more about how we think now, we could find new ways of thinking.

452
00:44:26,44 --> 00:44:34,25
So I think that's the golden nugget that It's very interesting to think with words and without words.

453
00:44:34,25 --> 00:44:43,48
The work that I do with [INAUDIBLE] one of our big goals and big picture, blue skies question, is whether

454
00:44:43,48 --> 00:44:46,73
and to what extent it's possible to think beyond words.

455
00:44:47,36 --> 00:44:53,04
And that's why we're so interested in looking at the constraints on our cognition,

456
00:44:53,8 --> 00:44:58,39
the patterns of thinking to see if that would generate new ways of thinking.

457
00:44:58,72 --> 00:45:06,56
I guess it's one of the main goals of art, is to examine ideas.

458
00:45:06,56 --> 00:45:15,51
So, I think one of the things we're interested in looking at constraints on our memories

459
00:45:15,52 --> 00:45:20,5
and our perceptions as being the first baby steps in that direction, cuz that's a [INAUDIBLE] question.

460
00:45:21,08 --> 00:45:25,69
We're not going to solve that question, but we might get a step closer to it.

461
00:45:26,33 --> 00:45:37,29
So it's trying to understand why is it we miss so much of what happened and we miss so much of what we see.

462
00:45:37,29 --> 00:45:38,47
Speaker 2: Is it?

463
00:45:38,47 --> 00:45:41,83
Nicky: Yeah, I think that's a really interesting question.

464
00:45:41,83 --> 00:45:42,75
Speaker 2: Do we miss a lot?

465
00:45:42,75 --> 00:45:43,7
Nicky: Yeah.

466
00:45:43,7 --> 00:45:45,93
Speaker 2: Can you explain that?

467
00:45:45,93 --> 00:45:50,95
Nicky: Well if we didn't, all magicians would be out of business wouldn't they?

468
00:45:52,24 --> 00:46:00,31
Because the magic effect capitalizes on the fact that there are a number of things that go on in a sequence that makes

469
00:46:03,13 --> 00:46:11,41
if we saw every move that the magician made in executing the fact, it wouldn't work as a magic trick.

470
00:46:11,41 --> 00:46:16,55
We'd go, thanks a lot. Why are you wasting my time?

471
00:46:16,83 --> 00:46:25,05
It's the fact that we know jolly well that that can't literally have vanished in thin air, and yet our eyes

472
00:46:25,67 --> 00:46:30,3
and our visual cortex, our mind, is telling us that that's precisely what happened.

473
00:46:30,3 --> 00:46:35,1
Speaker 2: So, it's a challenge between tricks or magic and how we think.

474
00:46:35,1 --> 00:46:36,74
Nicky: Well, that's just one example.

475
00:46:37,59 --> 00:46:43,31
Another example would be with memory, so that would be say tea lead should be catch,

476
00:46:43,31 --> 00:46:46,31
kind of an interacting because it is probably more powerful than two of us.

477
00:46:46,39 --> 00:46:52,03
But there's a phrase that we really like to use which is you do not remember what happened,

478
00:46:52,79 --> 00:47:00,34
what you remember becomes what happened. So the whole idea that actually, and we all know this.

479
00:47:00,34 --> 00:47:01,12
Speaker 2: Can you say that again?

480
00:47:01,12 --> 00:47:08,61
Nicky: Yeah, you don't remember what happened, what you remember becomes what happened.

481
00:47:08,61 --> 00:47:12,91
So, I think many people have had this experience.

482
00:47:12,91 --> 00:47:21,91
You've not seen a friend for years and you reminisce about, and if you went to it, it was a very memorable event,

483
00:47:22,28 --> 00:47:24,74
and it was a treasured memory for both of you.

484
00:47:25,35 --> 00:47:33,87
And you start comparing notes about the event, and you realize that your memories of the event don't match totally.

485
00:47:33,87 --> 00:47:35,21
Speaker 2: That's interesting.

486
00:47:35,21 --> 00:47:45,73
Nicky: You have a memory that she was wearing a beautiful pair of red shoes and she says, no, no, they were black.

487
00:47:47,00 --> 00:47:54,44
And she has a memory that you had a glass of champagne and you said no, no, I was drinking, I was driving,

488
00:47:54,69 --> 00:47:59,88
I was just drinking coconut water. And you're like well how can this be? How can our memories.

489
00:48:00,62 --> 00:48:08,06
And these are good friends, you know, we thought similarly. I'm not sharing this with an alien from another planet.

490
00:48:08,06 --> 00:48:11,88
His memory's just rubbish, or her memory's just inaccurate.

491
00:48:12,31 --> 00:48:15,88
You suddenly realize that there's a whole mismatch, it's how false memories work.

492
00:48:15,88 --> 00:48:33,76
Speaker 2: Can you compare a thought with something unique like your eyes or your face or your.

493
00:48:34,93 --> 00:48:37,47
Is it unique the way you think?

494
00:48:37,47 --> 00:48:41,12
Nicky: Well I think memories are unique, yes.

495
00:48:41,8 --> 00:48:48,86
I think it's very interesting that we often think of memory as being an active repository of the past. But it isn't.

496
00:48:49,65 --> 00:48:54,29
Our memories are extremely subjective and they're seen through our own eyes.

497
00:48:54,57 --> 00:49:02,82
So in our work with the captured thought, Clive and I talked about memories being the door to identity,

498
00:49:03,3 --> 00:49:05,99
because our memories shape who we are.

499
00:49:06,6 --> 00:49:14,53
And identities, our individuality shapes the way in which we choose to record

500
00:49:14,92 --> 00:49:27,42
and remember those instances that then become our memories. And that's why we don't remember what actually happened.

501
00:49:28,21 --> 00:49:35,41
We have a subjective take on it, we remember those bits that are of interest and relevance to us.

502
00:49:36,01 --> 00:49:43,73
And quite often we can discover that there are aspects of our memory that didn't even happen at all

503
00:49:43,77 --> 00:49:45,57
or happened in quite a different way.

504
00:49:46,54 --> 00:49:53,38
We can do that by sharing our memories with others and discovering there are bits of my memory

505
00:49:53,39 --> 00:49:56,36
and your memory of the same event that don't match.

506
00:49:56,36 --> 00:50:02,19
There is a lot of research that is been done on the notion of false memory by Elizabeth Lofsters,

507
00:50:02,46 --> 00:50:03,83
where she's found that,

508
00:50:04,35 --> 00:50:15,24
the way which you phrase the question can bias people to remember things in quite a different way than the way it

509
00:50:15,28 --> 00:50:20,89
actually happened. So you might show somebody a footage of an event.

510
00:50:20,89 --> 00:50:26,42
Let's say it's a car going at 20 miles an hour or 40 miles an hour,

511
00:50:27,69 --> 00:50:34,33
but actually the way in which you phrase the question afterwards that the car smashed into the lorry.

512
00:50:34,97 --> 00:50:43,81
Or the car bumped into the lorry will have a much more dramatic impact on the memory that that person has of the event

513
00:50:43,81 --> 00:50:48,16
than the actual speed that the car was going. False memory-

514
00:50:48,16 --> 00:50:49,56
Speaker 2: Memories, yeah.

515
00:50:49,56 --> 00:50:50,96
Nicky: Yes, memory.

516
00:50:50,96 --> 00:51:01,68
Speaker 2: Yeah, does it mean that the way we remember. You said that determines our identity.

517
00:51:01,68 --> 00:51:03,04
Nicky: That's right.

518
00:51:03,04 --> 00:51:06,76
Speaker 2: So it's very personal the way you think.

519
00:51:06,76 --> 00:51:12,41
Nicky: Yeah, yeah. Memories are subjective experiences.

520
00:51:12,41 --> 00:51:17,21
Speaker 2: So there are no two memories alike from different persons.

521
00:51:17,21 --> 00:51:21,45
Nicky: Well I think that they're all different.

522
00:51:21,6 --> 00:51:29,41
Even if it's with a loved one with whom you're very close and feel that you think in the same way.

523
00:51:29,8 --> 00:51:36,32
Your memories are still going to be slightly different because they're seen through a different set of eyes.

524
00:51:36,93 --> 00:51:44,23
And they're being filtered through a different mind, because everybody's experiences are different from one another.

525
00:51:44,83 --> 00:51:49,69
So I think even two identical twins would still have slightly different memories.

526
00:51:49,69 --> 00:51:56,33
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting. I never looked at it like that.

527
00:51:56,81 --> 00:52:02,54
I thought, well, if you have been at the same occasion, then you must remember same things.

528
00:52:02,54 --> 00:52:06,27
Nicky: Yeah, yeah but, we put our own subjective stamp on it.

529
00:52:06,8 --> 00:52:10,58
And, that's, I think, where integrating science

530
00:52:10,58 --> 00:52:18,3
and the arts just to do these kinds of questions becomes so important and, so insightful.

531
00:52:18,71 --> 00:52:22,4
Because, it's easy, as a scientist just to think very objectively,

532
00:52:22,82 --> 00:52:30,94
and go these are the things that have been remembered. Here's a list of things that happened in this event.

533
00:52:31,16 --> 00:52:36,65
It happened in this particular room at this time of day on a particular date.

534
00:52:37,04 --> 00:52:44,37
She was wearing this, he was wearing that. But that's not how our memories work. They're not just the series of labels.

535
00:52:44,37 --> 00:52:45,54
Speaker 2: And a series of facts.

536
00:52:45,54 --> 00:52:46,94
Nicky: A series of facts.

537
00:52:47,24 --> 00:52:55,85
It's about the emotional experience and that's the difference perhaps between,

538
00:52:56,64 --> 00:52:59,53
that's one aspect of why I would call it a thought.

539
00:53:01,96 --> 00:53:11,76
A series of facts or labels could be extremely objective but your thoughts are personal and they're subjective

540
00:53:12,09 --> 00:53:16,01
and sometimes they can change depending on how you're feeling on a particular day.

541
00:53:16,17 --> 00:53:22,3
So you may revisit a memory and in consequence of which you actually change it.

542
00:53:22,95 --> 00:53:26,89
You don't just revisit it and go down the list of things that happened

543
00:53:27,24 --> 00:53:32,33
but all of a sudden because of something else you've discovered in the interim

544
00:53:32,43 --> 00:53:39,11
or because of a different mood that you're in or well-being, you reshape it.

545
00:53:39,11 --> 00:53:48,99
Speaker 2: So can you say that the factual memory or the fact you remember are objective?

546
00:53:49,84 --> 00:54:03,91
But because who you are and because there's time that it gets filtered through your mind, gets subjective.

547
00:54:04,64 --> 00:54:08,59
And then that's how a thought is created?

548
00:54:08,59 --> 00:54:12,02
Nicky: Well sort of. I think it's a bit more complex than that.

549
00:54:12,02 --> 00:54:13,15
Speaker 2: More complex?

550
00:54:13,15 --> 00:54:22,2
Nicky: Yeah, well I think that there are factual labels that we remember with precision.

551
00:54:22,2 --> 00:54:26,03
London's the capital of England. No idea how I know that information.

552
00:54:26,32 --> 00:54:32,07
I don't have a memory of how I learned the information. But it's just something I know. And that's not going to change.

553
00:54:32,39 --> 00:54:40,5
I'm not going to revisit my knowledge that the fact that London is the capital of England, that's not going to change.

554
00:54:41,15 --> 00:54:49,71
But much of our memories are not purely factually based. They have all these other components to them.

555
00:54:50,3 --> 00:54:57,35
And the difference there I think arises A, because we've each got a unique pair of eyes

556
00:54:57,36 --> 00:55:02,5
and a unique mind that's filtering all those things as you've said.

557
00:55:03,14 --> 00:55:10,55
But I think it's also because we're selective in our attention. So we also don't see everything that's going on.

558
00:55:11,07 --> 00:55:15,77
And, therefore, for another reason why we might have different memories of the event,

559
00:55:16,09 --> 00:55:22,27
quite aside from with our different eyes, and different minds, is that, my viewpoint of what I see,

560
00:55:22,69 --> 00:55:25,93
is different to your viewpoint of what you see.

561
00:55:26,13 --> 00:55:32,96
So, we can both be looking at the bird, and I know that when you're looking at the bird,

562
00:55:32,96 --> 00:55:36,26
there's stuff behind me that you're going to see.

563
00:55:36,44 --> 00:55:40,97
And similarly you know that when I'm looking at the bird, I can see Clive,

564
00:55:41,41 --> 00:55:45,93
and I can see the background wall over there, which is not something that you can see at the moment,

565
00:55:46,13 --> 00:55:48,17
because you're looking at the bird, and you're looking at me.

566
00:55:48,84 --> 00:55:55,7
So, that's the selective attention difference, as well as a filtering difference. So, that's what I meant.

567
00:55:55,7 --> 00:55:56,4
Does that make sense?

568
00:55:56,4 --> 00:55:58,13
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I understand.

569
00:55:58,59 --> 00:56:17,71
Surely When you try to research crowds or children, how hard is it to, try to, understand alien brains?

570
00:56:17,71 --> 00:56:19,18
Nicky: Yes well it's.

571
00:56:19,18 --> 00:56:21,22
Speaker 2: Is it alien?

572
00:56:21,22 --> 00:56:25,7
Nicky: Well, I suppose it depends on your point of view.

573
00:56:25,91 --> 00:56:32,54
I've spent so many years trying to think about what its like to be a bird that, for me, it's not very alien at all.

574
00:56:33,64 --> 00:56:35,47
But at another level, of course, it's alien.

575
00:56:35,64 --> 00:56:44,67
Because however hard I try to imagine what it's like to be a crow, I'm not a crow and I never will be sadly.

576
00:56:45,63 --> 00:56:52,63
And however much I think about how children might be thinking it's a long time, sadly, since I was a child.

577
00:56:53,38 --> 00:56:58,73
And even when I was a child, I wasn't the same as the children I'm investigating.

578
00:56:59,13 --> 00:57:05,01
Because we've all these individual, subjective differences we've been talking about.

579
00:57:05,5 --> 00:57:12,64
So, all you can do scientifically, I think, is to present various kinds of problem

580
00:57:13,93 --> 00:57:21,46
and ask how the subjects be them crows or children or adult humans are solving the task.

581
00:57:21,74 --> 00:57:22,88
That's what you're trying to do.

582
00:57:22,88 --> 00:57:28,24
You're trying to look at what the constraints on the thinking are, what the milestones are,

583
00:57:28,83 --> 00:57:39,62
and how much individual differences there are in what those milestones are both within children and within the crows.

584
00:57:39,62 --> 00:57:42,95
Speaker 2: What exactly are you looking for?

585
00:57:42,95 --> 00:57:46,51
Nicky: I don't know what you mean by that.

586
00:57:46,51 --> 00:57:58,21
Speaker 2: Well, somehow you feel the need to research this, find out how thinking works

587
00:57:59,44 --> 00:58:08,36
and somehow try to find a kind of secret, cuz we don't know and you want to find out.

588
00:58:08,36 --> 00:58:21,73
Nicky: That's right. I'm interested in knowing what the constraints are on our thinking processes. And thinking about-

589
00:58:21,73 --> 00:58:25,84
Speaker 2: But is there a reason why you do this?

590
00:58:25,84 --> 00:58:34,83
Nicky: Well, I've always wanted to know what it's like to think like a bird.

591
00:58:35,03 --> 00:58:46,99
That's for sure, but I'm also interested in knowing whether there are new ways of thinking that we are not aware of.

592
00:58:47,54 --> 00:58:57,95
But by understanding better what some of these constraints are on our thinking processes that might give us clues into

593
00:58:57,96 --> 00:59:04,57
what these new ways of thinking might be. And, that's where the work that I do with Clive on the couch of thought.

594
00:59:04,89 --> 00:59:09,85
That's where that is so critical because by bringing in these different perspectives

595
00:59:10,22 --> 00:59:14,3
and trying to understand more about what those fundamental features are,

596
00:59:15,79 --> 00:59:22,51
that might help us better understand how we could improve our thinking skills

597
00:59:22,52 --> 00:59:26,9
or thinking new ways that we're not aware of at the moment.

598
00:59:26,9 --> 00:59:32,61
Speaker 2: Are you able to think in different ways?

599
00:59:32,61 --> 00:59:37,48
Nicky: Yes, I think so. I mean, I think-

600
00:59:37,48 --> 00:59:39,98
Speaker 2: So you can think in words?

601
00:59:39,98 --> 00:59:46,38
Nicky: I think most of us can think without words as well.

602
00:59:46,61 --> 00:59:53,49
As I said to you before, when Clive and I were dancing tango together I am not.

603
00:59:53,49 --> 01:00:01,71
Speaker 2: But, I try to understand because if I think what I probably thinking works

604
01:00:01,71 --> 01:00:12,62
but I never had a thought about it. So, I try to be aware of the ways I can think.

605
01:00:12,62 --> 01:00:13,76
Nicky: Okay, well.

606
01:00:13,76 --> 01:00:15,07
Speaker 2: Our viewers can think.

607
01:00:15,07 --> 01:00:24,98
Nicky: Yeah, well, let me try to think of an example then of something more simple. Do you like wine?

608
01:00:24,98 --> 01:00:25,98
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

609
01:00:25,98 --> 01:00:31,55
Nicky: Imagine I've just poured you a glass of wine. You take a sip of it.

610
01:00:32,35 --> 01:00:37,04
It's really nice, it's the nicest wine you can ever remember tasting.

611
01:00:37,04 --> 01:00:39,49
If you have this gorgeous experience,

612
01:00:40,48 --> 01:00:50,34
words aren't really going to describe for you that experience of the taste of that exquisite wine..

613
01:00:48,5 --> 01:00:54,24
We use artificial words [INAUDIBLE] We say this one's got lots of cherries and black currant

614
01:00:54,29 --> 01:01:02,00
but it's a glass of wine and it's made from grape juice. There aren't any cherries or blackcurrants really in there.

615
01:01:02,00 --> 01:01:11,22
There are only labels that we're trying to attach to these things to share our experiences of this thing that's really

616
01:01:11,26 --> 01:01:21,14
an experience. It's not and the words are only a rough approximation of the way of sharing the experiences.

617
01:01:22,1 --> 01:01:25,01
So that's the kind of thing that I suppose I mean.

618
01:01:25,01 --> 01:01:31,71
And somehow just putting words on it in the same way as with the tango.

619
01:01:32,05 --> 01:01:37,93
Just saying well Clive led me into a backward arch sort of thing.

620
01:01:39,51 --> 01:01:46,18
It doesn't describe the exquisite experience of dancing tango.

621
01:01:46,4 --> 01:01:54,31
It’s just a label for whether I've put my feet forward or backwards, but it doesn't really capture.

622
01:01:55,88 --> 01:01:59,1
It captures the tiniest little aspect of that.

623
01:01:59,1 --> 01:02:02,46
Speaker 2: So, words fall short.

624
01:02:02,46 --> 01:02:04,74
Nicky: Words fall short, yeah.

625
01:02:04,74 --> 01:02:06,6
Speaker 2: For thinking.

626
01:02:06,6 --> 01:02:07,39
Nicky: For thinking.

627
01:02:07,39 --> 01:02:12,59
Speaker 2: I never looked at it like that.

628
01:02:12,59 --> 01:02:25,43
Speaker 2: Is it possible not to think?

629
01:02:25,43 --> 01:02:42,19
Nicky: Yes, when you're dead. [LAUGH] I think it's pretty impossible not to think when you're alive though.

630
01:02:43,55 --> 01:02:46,49
Whether you're aware of the sorts is another matter.

631
01:02:47,12 --> 01:02:55,95
So, there are very interesting cases of people who don't necessarily have conscious access to their thoughts.

632
01:03:00,89 --> 01:03:07,13
Classic case of that would be an amnesic with severe memory loss who doesn't have access to.

633
01:03:07,54 --> 01:03:10,92
They've witnessed the event, but somehow the events haven't been,

634
01:03:10,92 --> 01:03:20,13
they don't have conscious access to what happened at all, or patients with blind sight who can see

635
01:03:20,13 --> 01:03:23,29
but they're not aware that they can see.

636
01:03:23,55 --> 01:03:30,51
So, if you ask them did you see that, they say no, no, I haven't seen anything, I'm blind.

637
01:03:31,02 --> 01:03:34,8
But then if you say just guess, they're highly accurate.

638
01:03:34,8 --> 01:03:40,88
So their eyes have seen it but their brain hasn't registered the information that they're actually seeing it.

639
01:03:40,88 --> 01:03:53,99
Speaker 2: Have you ever considered the thought that when you die, that the only thing that survives are your thoughts?

640
01:03:53,99 --> 01:03:54,99
Nicky: No.

641
01:03:54,99 --> 01:04:04,16
Speaker 2: To come up with it, because you say well you stop thinking when you're dead,

642
01:04:04,31 --> 01:04:07,22
but maybe then only your body dies.

643
01:04:07,22 --> 01:04:09,46
Speaker 2: Do you understand what I mean?

644
01:04:09,46 --> 01:04:11,62
Nicky: Yeah, but where would those thoughts go?

645
01:04:11,62 --> 01:04:16,39
Speaker 2: I don't know. [LAUGH]

646
01:04:16,39 --> 01:04:21,6
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think out loud because just-

647
01:04:21,6 --> 01:04:21,95
Nicky: Yeah.

648
01:04:21,95 --> 01:04:28,96
Speaker 2: Maybe that would be interesting because it's hard not to think.

649
01:04:28,96 --> 01:04:35,3
Speaker 3: The thoughts do carry on in actual fact, because they carried on within culture and within society,

650
01:04:35,3 --> 01:04:39,4
aren't they? [CROSSTALK] Music by Beethoven for example.

651
01:04:39,4 --> 01:04:45,00
Speaker 2: It's a bit hard to, if you answer the questions and we cannot film you, you understand? [CROSSTALK]

652
01:04:45,00 --> 01:04:46,77
Speaker 2: I'm just adding something to your question.

653
01:04:46,77 --> 01:04:48,02
Nicky: Yeah. [CROSSTALK]

654
01:04:48,02 --> 01:04:51,25
Speaker 2: That's why I didn't listen too well.

655
01:04:51,25 --> 01:04:57,31
Speaker 3: Maybe you can- I was only prompting you to ask the next question,

656
01:04:57,31 --> 01:05:03,91
which was that the thoughts of one person don't necessarily die when they die,

657
01:05:04,24 --> 01:05:07,83
if those ideas are culturally relevant- [CROSSTALK] transferred to their

658
01:05:07,83 --> 01:05:08,83
Speaker 2: Okay.

659
01:05:08,83 --> 01:05:13,25
Nicky: Thank you, Donald, it's good, yeah.

660
01:05:13,25 --> 01:05:16,44
Speaker 2: That's a good, so, I suppose that's. [INAUDIBLE]

661
01:05:16,44 --> 01:05:23,68
Nicky: I suppose that's where memory as a shared experience comes in. That although the-

662
01:05:23,68 --> 01:05:26,81
Speaker 2: So, where does it come in?

663
01:05:26,81 --> 01:05:30,62
Nicky: Memory as a shared experience comes in.

664
01:05:31,03 --> 01:05:37,71
The whole idea is that although your thoughts and your memories are individual, they're personal and subjective to you,

665
01:05:38,16 --> 01:05:40,62
you can nonetheless share them with others.

666
01:05:41,37 --> 01:05:47,66
And in multiple ways, right, you can share them by discussing with one another, like we're doing here.

667
01:05:48,22 --> 01:05:56,61
You can share them by creating something exquisite, like a Beethoven symphony,

668
01:05:57,54 --> 01:06:03,06
that lives on long after Beethoven himself.

669
01:06:04,23 --> 01:06:10,77
Or a beautiful piece of literature that the author dies, but nonetheless,

670
01:06:11,42 --> 01:06:19,48
all the thoughts as represented in the novel remain. So in all those ways their thoughts can live on.

671
01:06:20,5 --> 01:06:25,12
Although of course, there's a sense in which they live on and a sense in which they die.

672
01:06:25,34 --> 01:06:31,5
Because the subjective experience of the originator of the thought, those thoughts have died.

673
01:06:32,04 --> 01:06:40,35
But the shared experience of the thoughts, in the way in which those thoughts interpreted by others, live on.

674
01:06:41,7 --> 01:06:45,9
And I suppose that's what history does, isn't it? You have these ideas that are recorded.

675
01:06:46,93 --> 01:06:56,73
But actually as others revisit the history, just as a memory is changed when it's revisited, so is history,

676
01:06:57,18 --> 01:07:04,74
so are the thoughts. So there's a level at which they live on, but they don't, they are changed.

677
01:07:04,74 --> 01:07:14,06
Speaker 2: But they also get richer somehow, because now we know this music and this music and this music,

678
01:07:15,11 --> 01:07:22,78
and still we manage to make new music which is beautiful.

679
01:07:22,78 --> 01:07:28,61
Nicky: Yeah, yeah, and the way in which it's interpreted will change, because of the new technologies,

680
01:07:28,99 --> 01:07:30,87
because of the new experiences.

681
01:07:30,87 --> 01:07:31,87
Speaker 2: Yeah.

682
01:07:31,87 --> 01:07:35,62
Nicky: So, in a way these thoughts

683
01:07:35,63 --> 01:07:47,14
and these memories are much more than just this little snippet of factual accurate information about the past.

684
01:07:47,44 --> 01:07:55,21
They infuse and purveyed our history and our culture.

685
01:07:55,21 --> 01:07:56,31
Speaker 2: Good and bad.

686
01:07:56,31 --> 01:07:59,93
Nicky: Good and bad, and our evolution, if you like, as a species.

687
01:07:59,93 --> 01:08:05,72
Speaker 2: So why do you want to fly? [LAUGH]

688
01:08:05,72 --> 01:08:17,79
Nicky: I don't know how to put that into words really. I've always been,

689
01:08:17,79 --> 01:08:23,93
Nicky: Fascinated by what it's like to be at the,

690
01:08:24,45 --> 01:08:33,72
I've always been fascinated with being able to move in a three dimensional world instead of being stuck on terra firma.

691
01:08:33,72 --> 01:08:49,25
Nicky: It's just, it feels like it's a fundamental feature of me. And yet, somehow I have difficulty verbalizing it.

692
01:08:49,59 --> 01:08:56,41
Perhaps, because the kind of subjective experiences and thoughts associated with wanting to fly

693
01:08:57,08 --> 01:09:04,03
and wanting to be a bird are largely wordless.

694
01:09:04,03 --> 01:09:11,73
Speaker 2: So what is it, is it onwards? Is it onward?

695
01:09:11,73 --> 01:09:17,92
Nicky: Thoughts, we're just thoughts, yeah.

696
01:09:17,92 --> 01:09:27,87
Speaker 2: But somehow, there has to be original view as a child thinking, I would like to fly.

697
01:09:27,87 --> 01:09:31,29
Nicky: I suppose it's the freedom, isn't it?

698
01:09:31,29 --> 01:09:41,18
The whole idea of being able to explore the world from up above, to be in the sky and look down and see more

699
01:09:41,81 --> 01:09:42,75
and see further.

700
01:09:42,75 --> 01:09:52,74
Nicky: And just see that you could have a totally different perspective on how the world looks.

701
01:09:52,74 --> 01:09:54,57
Speaker 2: You still have this wish?

702
01:09:54,57 --> 01:09:57,07
Nicky: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very much so.

703
01:09:57,07 --> 01:10:07,82
Nicky: But somehow I didn't have words that really do it justice.

704
01:10:07,82 --> 01:10:11,42
Speaker 2: Is this a wish you have all your life?

705
01:10:11,42 --> 01:10:13,75
Nicky: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
01:10:13,75 --> 01:10:24,11
Speaker 2: And, how do you keep this alive? But do you keep these alive, or do you need this idea to keep on going?

707
01:10:24,11 --> 01:10:28,25
Nicky: [LAUGH] I don't think about it like that, it's just part of me.

708
01:10:28,25 --> 01:10:37,47
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I don't think of flying like a bird. So, there's something inside you, which,

709
01:10:37,47 --> 01:10:45,7
Nicky: Well I suppose we all have our spirituality, don't we?

710
01:10:45,78 --> 01:10:51,49
We all have those things that we identify as being sort of core features of ourselves.

711
01:10:51,49 --> 01:10:55,05
And the different people are different things, but.

712
01:10:55,05 --> 01:10:56,05
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

713
01:10:56,05 --> 01:11:04,65
Speaker 2: Yeah, so when we go tomorrow, to this lab.

714
01:11:04,65 --> 01:11:05,08
Nicky: Yep.

715
01:11:05,08 --> 01:11:08,31
Speaker 2: We will see a lot of children?

716
01:11:08,31 --> 01:11:10,22
Speaker 2: Or is that tomorrow?

717
01:11:10,22 --> 01:11:16,26
Nicky: Yeah, we're doing children tomorrow and the day after, I believe. Elsa's got a little program.

718
01:11:16,26 --> 01:11:28,25
Speaker 2: So what do you hope to find out with these deaths or procedures or with children?

719
01:11:28,25 --> 01:11:31,85
Nicky: Let's talk about that when we do though, cuz there's lot of different ones.

720
01:11:31,85 --> 01:11:32,22
Speaker 2: Okay.

721
01:11:32,22 --> 01:11:38,69
Nicky: So I'd rather kind of do it with the tests there, cuz otherwise it's gonna be a bit jumbled and jarbled,

722
01:11:39,26 --> 01:11:39,93
I think.

723
01:11:39,93 --> 01:11:42,98
Speaker 2: Yeah,so when you dance, you dance everywhere?

724
01:11:42,98 --> 01:11:46,71
Nicky: What do you mean?

725
01:11:46,71 --> 01:11:55,43
Speaker 2: Well, did you dance outside, or at home, or at a lab, or at a club?

726
01:11:56,51 --> 01:12:02,01
This dancing, you mean, this Tango dancing? Where do you do that?

727
01:12:02,01 --> 01:12:09,75
Nicky: We go to Melongas, which are dance halls, that's the main place you do tango.

728
01:12:10,12 --> 01:12:12,35
And we do them in our talks and performances.

729
01:12:12,35 --> 01:12:12,95
Speaker 2: Okay.

730
01:12:12,95 --> 01:12:15,55
Nicky: I guess sometime we dance at home.

731
01:12:15,55 --> 01:12:24,89
Speaker 2: The last question is, why the tango because you're both not from Argentina?

732
01:12:24,89 --> 01:12:33,63
Nicky: Gosh I don't know how to answer that. It's the poetry of movement, I think, tango.

733
01:12:33,97 --> 01:12:42,69
It's such a beautiful dance because it's, you're so connected with your partner. They talk about it as being four legs.

734
01:12:42,69 --> 01:12:53,6
An animal with four legs and two beating hearts, cuz you're so connected. So there's many forms of dance that I love.

735
01:12:53,6 --> 01:12:57,09
I like ballet and salsa's great fun,

736
01:12:57,43 --> 01:13:06,14
but there's something very powerful about tango because of the connection you have with your partner, so the leader

737
01:13:06,15 --> 01:13:13,99
and the follower, and the way in which you respond as one to the music. I think it's very, very special.

738
01:13:13,99 --> 01:13:19,73
Speaker 2: Does every scientist have this artist inside?

739
01:13:19,73 --> 01:13:22,49
Nicky: Sorry, does every?

740
01:13:22,49 --> 01:13:25,16
Speaker 2: Does every scientist have an artist inside?

741
01:13:25,16 --> 01:13:26,83
Nicky: I don't know.

742
01:13:26,83 --> 01:13:36,9
Nicky: It's not very common is it to be a scientist and be an artist in residence somewhere. And equally, of course.

743
01:13:36,9 --> 01:13:38,8
Speaker 2: The other way around.

744
01:13:38,8 --> 01:13:41,45
Nicky: There's artists in residence in the psychology department.

745
01:13:41,77 --> 01:13:45,31
So I think we've got something there that is quite unique.

746
01:13:45,88 --> 01:13:54,5
You do hear of artists in residence, but typically, they're short term residences of three months of most the year.

747
01:13:54,84 --> 01:14:00,68
And usually it's the artist comes in to a place, talks to people and then creates a piece of art.

748
01:14:01,5 --> 01:14:11,03
Where as I think that for captured thought what Clive and I do is truly collaborative.

749
01:14:11,91 --> 01:14:16,76
It's not Clive comes and has a cup of coffee with me and then creates something.

750
01:14:17,09 --> 01:14:22,57
I have a chat with Clive and we go off and do an experiment. And occasionally we meet up and talk about them.

751
01:14:22,71 --> 01:14:29,52
I mean the whole project that we're doing is interwoven together.

752
01:14:30,00 --> 01:14:36,17
So all our talks are written jointly and performed jointly.

753
01:14:37,4 --> 01:14:52,67
And you might think of it as being 50% Nicki and 50% Clive, but really it's more like two percent Nicki

754
01:14:53,00 --> 01:15:00,12
and two percent Clive and 96% licking Clive integrated

755
01:15:00,13 --> 01:15:07,39
and two percent I'm only saying because obviously one voice is speaking while the other is silent and then vice versa.

756
01:15:07,99 --> 01:15:21,53
But all the thoughts and all the ideas are, have collaborative mixture, and I hope

757
01:15:21,72 --> 01:15:30,33
and I think that as a result it's like a Gestalt phenomenon that we are being able to share more

758
01:15:30,34 --> 01:15:33,95
and do more than either of us could do alone.

759
01:15:34,38 --> 01:15:40,92
I certainly feel that I wouldn't have got so nearly so far in my thinking about things if it hadn't been for Clive

760
01:15:40,93 --> 01:15:44,53
and I collaborating. And it's not just an odd discussion here and there.

761
01:15:44,68 --> 01:15:51,2
It really is this integrated, interwoven working together and thinking together.

762
01:15:52,72 --> 01:16:00,16
And trying to make new connections between disparate sources, that alone I wouldn't have thought of.

763
01:16:00,61 --> 01:16:08,32
But together, with Clive, we can kind of push each other to explore further.

764
01:16:09,75 --> 01:16:19,88
So that's why I feel that it's more than what you normally see in a collaboration. It's an integration.
