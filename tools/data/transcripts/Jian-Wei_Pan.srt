100:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,458Could you tell me what is so fascinating about quantum mechanics?200:00:08,125 --> 00:00:16,000There are two aspects I find most fascinating about quantum mechanics.300:00:16,208 --> 00:00:24,250The first aspect is that... this is a difficult question actually, I have to think about it a little bit.400:00:28,500 --> 00:00:42,000What is so fascinating about quantum mechanics is that until now no one truly understands quantum mechanics, especially this interesting concept called quantum superposition.500:00:42,625 --> 00:00:47,250What quantum superposition leads to is this concept called quantum entanglement.600:00:49,542 --> 00:00:55,250Even though it has been over a hundred years since we have come up with quantum mechanics, we still don't understand why there is quantum entanglement.700:00:55,833 --> 00:00:59,667So the more you don't understand, the more interesting it becomes.800:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,250  And can you explain entanglement, what it is, what it means?900:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,208The basic principles of quantum entanglement can be understood like this:1000:01:12,417 --> 00:01:18,500Let's say we have two dice, like the ones we normally use for gambling.1100:01:20,875 --> 00:01:26,208It doesn't matter how far apart the dice are, one could be in China and the other in the Netherlands.1200:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000So if you roll your dice and then call to ask me, "Jian Wei, do you know what my dice says?"1300:01:35,208 --> 00:01:39,833I just have to look at the dice in my hand and can tell you what your dice says.1400:01:40,417 --> 00:01:49,208It's to say that no matter how great the distance between the dice is, according to Einstein there is some strange interaction between these two far away locations.1500:01:49,667 --> 00:01:54,708When the result appears here, the far away dice has the same result.1600:01:55,958 --> 00:02:00,583This is a typical result we get when we experiment with quantum entanglement.1700:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,375What I like about your work is that you somehow are able to put the theory into practice.1800:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000Can you elaborate on that?1900:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,833There are two types of people study quantum mechanics.2000:02:24,708 --> 00:02:29,958The first type goes, "This is what quantum entanglement is; we don't have to understand why it exists."2100:02:30,083 --> 00:02:36,208They go straight onto testing physics phenomena within the physical system.2200:02:36,292 --> 00:02:39,833And this has resulted in various useful applications such as2300:02:40,083 --> 00:02:47,833semiconductor lasers, nuclear magnetic resonance, giant magnetoresistance, and even energy generation.2400:02:48,042 --> 00:03:00,000Because these type experiments on condensed state and quantum phenomena but do not ask why entanglement exists, they have already greatly changed our lives. 2500:03:00,100 --> 00:03:10,250The other type, my and colleagues in the U.S. and Europe, including the Netherlands, also have had great results when last year2600:03:10,417 --> 00:03:15,083we conducted experiments on the existence of quantum entanglement.2700:03:15,583 --> 00:03:28,000During this process we gradually developed a technique to actively control one or more particles.2800:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000Once you can actively control particles, a new field emerges2900:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,500called quantum information science. 3000:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,667Quantum information science has some practical applications.3100:03:39,042 --> 00:03:43,000The first is quantum communications.3200:03:43,208 --> 00:03:51,750Quantum communication can theoretically provide us with an unfailingly safe communication method.3300:03:51,917 --> 00:03:57,583This could transform cyber security3400:03:57,750 --> 00:04:06,458This is very important to our daily lives and of our desires to keep our secrets secure. 3500:04:07,000 --> 00:04:26,000If I tangle up the tiny particles that make up the quantum world, they will gain a great computational ability that we can use for quantum computation.3600:04:26,417 --> 00:04:38,542For example, if we combine all of the computational power on Earth we can perhaps count to 2^80 a year.3700:04:39,083 --> 00:04:53,750But if we can harness only a hundred of those small, entangled particles, it may hold a counting power a million times more powerful than all of Earth's computational power combined.3800:04:54,000 --> 00:05:08,208That's to say if there were a million Earths in this universe, all these Earths combined would have the same computational power as what we could achieve with 100 tiny particles.3900:05:08,333 --> 00:05:14,375When you think about it this way, quantum communications can bring about a great advancement in computational power.4000:05:14,833 --> 00:05:21,417The third aspect is that we can use quantum mechanics for getting close measurements, called quantum measurements.4100:05:21,625 --> 00:05:33,000Quantum measurement could greatly advance GPS navigation and make it more precise. 4200:05:33,208 --> 00:05:42,833We could also use the same techniques to advance biomedical detection technology as well. 4300:05:43,042 --> 00:05:55,417Now you can see that this very fundamental, physics question can be used for many practical real life applications. 4400:05:58,250 --> 00:06:10,667When I visualise a quantum computer, what does it look like?4500:06:12,167 --> 00:06:16,042People often ask me this question. 4600:06:16,208 --> 00:06:26,333If we try to picture a regular computing device, we would picture a everyday computer with computer chips, like a PC.4700:06:26,458 --> 00:06:38,000However if we go back 200 years, people in China would have used an abacus made out of bamboo to do calculations.4800:06:38,125 --> 00:06:50,542If someone back then tried to imagine what a computer should look like, they would imagine something made out of wood, or bamboo, or perhaps marble.4900:06:50,875 --> 00:06:57,083So I think that currently it is hard to imagine what a quantum computer would look like.5000:06:57,208 --> 00:07:03,625I can tell you though, that I once had a dream about a quantum computer. 5100:07:03,833 --> 00:07:21,500That quantum computer was not like a typical computer, but was a pile of material that was neither solid nor liquid, and was constantly shifting and emitting a blue light.5200:07:22,125 --> 00:07:27,250It is hard to imagine what an actual quantum computer from the future would look like. 5300:07:27,542 --> 00:07:35,292Currently many scientists around the world are taking different approaches to try constructing a quantum computer 5400:07:35,583 --> 00:07:48,833Some people are using photon, others are using atoms, and some are even using superconducting qubits.5500:07:49,417 --> 00:08:00,000So in the future there might be many different types of quantum computers made out of different martials that can perform different functions.5600:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,958So it is very difficult to say what a quantum computer is going to look like.5700:08:05,292 --> 00:08:15,500When I look at your work in quantum satellites, what big step is that?5800:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,750What happened last week, can you elaborate on that?5900:08:19,083 --> 00:08:29,083We are ecstatic that we were able to successfully launch the first ever quantum science satellite.6000:08:29,333 --> 00:08:36,667After the launch we went through several days of testing, and so far the satellite has been functioning stably.6100:08:36,792 --> 00:08:41,750There were several reasons we wanted to launch this quantum science satellite.6200:08:42,292 --> 00:08:55,000The first was that if we use fibre optics for quantum communication on the ground, because quantum signals cannot replicate it would be difficult for signals to get very far. 6300:08:55,208 --> 00:09:07,917One of our colleagues in Switzerland, Nicolas Gisin estimated that if we have a thousand kilometre of fibre optics6400:09:08,333 --> 00:09:17,542and even if we use the very best technology available to make this quantum communications device6500:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,417we can only send a single byte(?) of information every 300 years .6600:09:22,958 --> 00:09:29,333So this is not very useful for long distance quantum communication.6700:09:29,625 --> 00:09:46,792But what is interesting is that if we have a quantum satellite which can send signals through the air, according to our theories and what we have tried to build, we can send several hundred kb(?) of information over a thousand kilometres, every second.6800:09:47,042 --> 00:09:54,292This is enough to transmit important quantum information tasks securely. 6900:09:54,583 --> 00:10:05,417This also means after launching into the atmosphere, we are able to do experiments that were not to do on the ground. 7000:10:05,625 --> 00:10:11,708Also from a scientistâ€™s perspective, this is an important contribution to fundamental research.7100:10:12,042 --> 00:10:24,917Once we are able to send send quantum light particles through the atmosphere we have the ability to investigate whether quantum entanglement exists and 7200:10:25,250 --> 00:10:35,083what kind of changes will be happen to the quantum state under the influence of relativity and gravity. 7300:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,792One likely possibility is that we will move towards testing quantum mechanics in space.7400:10:41,167 --> 00:10:49,000And once we are in space, we we can conduct further investigations on quantum nonlocality on a larger scale.7500:10:49,417 --> 00:11:01,160According an American colleague Tony Leggett, there is one last experiment in quantum physics nonlocality we have not yet performed7600:11:01,167 --> 00:11:20,375To do the final test of quantum nonlocality, we have to observe quantum entanglement separated over a distance of 300 thousand km, when there will be only residual free will. 7700:11:20,792 --> 00:11:27,292So we will have the ability to conduct that final test of quantum nonlocality.7800:11:27,833 --> 00:11:42,208Everyone really hopes that we can unify quantum and gravity theories into a theory of everything7900:11:42,458 --> 00:11:48,542There are many models for this, but which one of these is compatible with the natural world?8000:11:48,875 --> 00:12:01,958When we transport quantum photon hundreds of thousands of kilometres away, we can test many different quantum models.8100:12:02,292 --> 00:12:08,458Let's see if we can shift the boundaries of physics exploration.8200:12:08,625 --> 00:12:17,000It's mainly because of these two reasons: practical and fundamental research.8300:12:17,417 --> 00:12:23,250The theory of everything; could you explain a little bit more what that is?8400:12:23,750 --> 00:12:30,083Us physicists all have all have this ultimate dream.8500:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,583Currently we know of four fundaments forces of nature within the natural world.8600:12:35,042 --> 00:12:46,375We have known of gravity the longest, and then we have electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.8700:12:46,833 --> 00:12:57,917We already have a standard model in which we have unified electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.8800:12:58,292 --> 00:13:09,875So what we dream of now, which Einstein had started to do, is to combine all four forces into one unified theory.8900:13:10,208 --> 00:13:17,375But in this process of unifying has had many difficulties, and fitting gravity into this is a great challenge.9000:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,708Scientists have developed many different theories about this, such as quantum gravity.9100:13:23,958 --> 00:13:30,333Quantum gravity tries to combine the theories of relativity and gravity.9200:13:30,583 --> 00:13:41,708If we can combine these theories, according to our current understanding we will have created a theory of everything, a theory that we can use to explain every natural phenomena.9300:13:42,042 --> 00:13:51,917But there are many candidate theories, so which one is the one truly reflective of our natural world?9400:13:52,000 --> 00:14:06,792You've got this theory of everything. The steps you have been taking in the past year, when you look at the theory of everything, how big of a step have you made?9500:14:07,208 --> 00:14:16,375In order to do these kind of experiments the first important step is to move the laboratory to space.9600:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,083We have officially only started making satellites in 2007 and before that we have done related experiments on the ground for a while.9700:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,417The earliest we have done these kinds of experiments is in 2003.9800:14:33,625 --> 00:14:39,458It is through many years of effort we could move our experiments to the atmosphere.9900:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,625On the way we have developed and refined techniques. 10000:14:44,750 --> 00:14:52,292The parameters of our satellite is based on the calculations done by an American colleague Paul Grant(?). 10100:14:52,667 --> 00:15:03,667With our techniques we can now make a highly precise telescope that can see a license plate on one of Jupiter's moons.10200:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,208This is because our spacial resolution is very high. 10300:15:11,625 --> 00:15:19,292We also have to be able to accurately detect of low-level light. 10400:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,667Now lets say we are on the Moon, and you light a match to smoke a cigarette.10500:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,375When you strike the match you produce light, and we need to be able to perceive that light on Earth.10600:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,542When we have the refined technology to do so, if we are successful in our experiments this time10700:15:36,667 --> 00:15:51,042we hope for our next step that we can work with China's lunar landing programme and experiment with distanced quantum entanglement of 300 thousand kilometres apart. 10800:15:51,125 --> 00:15:56,125Currently we have completed some experiments on the ground 10900:15:56,458 --> 00:16:04,083so if the upcoming tests are successful, we should be able to achieve hundreds of thousands of kilometres distanced quantum entanglement.11000:16:04,542 --> 00:16:18,417After these tasks have been completed, I think we can then conduct the primary investigations into the accuracy of proposed quantum models I have mentioned earlier.11100:16:18,667 --> 00:16:23,667So we have three steps, and this is just the first.11200:16:26,250 --> 00:16:32,375When you say three steps, what are the three steps?11300:16:34,375 --> 00:16:46,875The first step is hopefully to conduct important tests in the air, test if it feasible to do so. 11400:16:47,167 --> 00:16:51,792After testing, we will be able to realise new quantum ground11500:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,667that can be used for secure quantum communication.11600:16:56,833 --> 00:17:02,500The second step is for a 1200 kilometre quantum entanglement distribution11700:17:02,958 --> 00:17:12,500to discover if quantum engagement can still occur with a separation of thousands of kilometres.11800:17:12,667 --> 00:17:24,667With the foundations from these two experiments, we can go on with the second step, which is to have a satellite between the Moon and Earth11900:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,875at the Lagrangian point, from where we will distribute two points of quantum entanglement. 12000:17:30,208 --> 00:17:43,792This way we achieve free willed quantum nonlocality from a great collective distance of 300 thousand kilometres. 12100:17:43,917 --> 00:17:50,833According to our colleague Tony Leggett, if after we conduct this experiment we will prove the nonlocality of quantum mechanics. 12200:17:50,917 --> 00:17:57,250The theory of quantum nonlocality will be confirmed and the debate will end.12300:17:57,417 --> 00:18:05,292With these foundations we will then use the techniques we have developed to transmit light over a great distance12400:18:05,833 --> 00:18:11,042to investigate quantum gravity models.12500:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,458These are the three steps12600:18:18,542 --> 00:18:23,917Entanglement communication, how does that work, what do you mean by that?12700:18:25,083 --> 00:18:32,167We have two kinds of experiments with quantum key distribution12800:18:33,125 --> 00:18:41,583The first type is using a single photon, and not using quantum entanglement12900:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,208This occurs between a satellite and the ground.13000:18:44,333 --> 00:18:53,792There will be a weak light source from the satellite which will shoot several hundred individual photons to the ground every second.13100:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,667On the ground there is a ordinary antenna that will receive the signal13200:18:58,958 --> 00:19:04,167and can conduct classical communication with the satellite.13300:19:04,333 --> 00:19:10,250After a couple exchanges we come up with a indecipherable key together.13400:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,875Here we have used two fundamental principles. 13500:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,958The first is called quantum indivisibility.13600:19:18,125 --> 00:19:25,083Let's say we are drinking a glass of water and I split the glass of water into two half glasses of water13700:19:25,458 --> 00:19:29,208And we split the half glasses of water, which are now a quarter full.13800:19:29,667 --> 00:19:41,167After slowly dividing we now have single water molecules13900:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,583but we canâ€™t have half molecules or quarter molecules. 14000:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,542This is the same with light. 14100:19:47,708 --> 00:19:55,750If you take a 25 W light bulb and magnify it, you can see that the light is composed of individual particles.14200:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,917We call these particles photons, a single quantum. 14300:20:00,042 --> 00:20:07,333If someone tries to eavesdrop, he cannot divide the photon in half14400:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,417so either the eavesdropper steals away the photon or it will  not be stolen and the photon reach the ground.14500:20:12,583 --> 00:20:17,917The photons that reach the ground are the ones that were not stolen by the eavesdropper.14600:20:18,125 --> 00:20:24,250Using this method you can say if you have been eavesdropped on, you won't receive a signal and you can give up on those signals. 14700:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,125This is its first principle. 14800:20:27,375 --> 00:20:34,167The other principle is quantum superposition14900:20:34,667 --> 00:20:43,417Quantum superposition guarantees the quantum no cloning theorem. 15000:20:43,667 --> 00:20:53,208When a photon is being transmitted, if you take a picture of it with a camera and you want to measure and make a copy of it15100:20:53,417 --> 00:21:02,500this influences the photonâ€™s state of being so that when you receive the signal on the ground you will know that the signal has been observed by someone else. 15200:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,750You can then reject the signal15300:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,333Because quantums have two characteristics15400:21:06,458 --> 00:21:10,542the first being indivisibility, which says it is individual and whole15500:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750the second being that it cannot be copied15600:21:15,917 --> 00:21:19,375we can guarantee the security of the quantum key.15700:21:21,667 --> 00:21:23,167This is the first type of quantum key distribution, which has nothing to do with quantum entanglement. 15800:21:23,458 --> 00:21:29,042Once we can apply quantum entanglement to quantum key distribution15900:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,333we can have our satellite be our source of quantum entanglement during our experiments.16000:21:35,583 --> 00:21:43,583It will produce several tens of millions of entangled photons every second and16100:21:43,958 --> 00:21:50,167they will be distributed to two points on the surface of the earth that are  approximately 1200 km apart. 16200:21:50,667 --> 00:21:56,833If you detect a photon on one point it is guaranteed we will detect an entangled photon on the other point. 16300:21:57,042 --> 00:22:02,208If you don't detect anything at that point than the other point will also come up empty. 16400:22:02,417 --> 00:22:03,875If there is one here, there is one there. 16500:22:04,042 --> 00:22:08,083This kind of situation is called a state of quantum entanglement. 16600:22:08,208 --> 00:22:15,375With this connection, you can achieve quantum key distribution.16700:22:15,542 --> 00:22:22,292You can either use single photons or quantum entanglement to achieve quantum communication. 16800:22:25,917 --> 00:22:36,125Why is your team, your lab, so ahead of other labs in the world?16900:22:36,458 --> 00:22:39,750I think this is because of three reasons.17000:22:40,292 --> 00:22:50,708First of all I was lucky to be in Austria to join Zeilinger's team in 1996 when they were first starting out. 17100:22:51,083 --> 00:23:00,625I was a PhD student at the time, and was very lucky to be a part of the first wave of people working on quantum communications. 17200:23:01,083 --> 00:23:14,625By chance I was one of the founding members of the team that grappled with the first theories and techniques of quantum communications.17300:23:15,125 --> 00:23:23,042Later in China, we started to work with quantum communications and we needed the latest technology to get a satellite launched.17400:23:23,042 --> 00:23:32,625Our team is composed of those who have picked up the latest lab skills from all around the world17500:23:32,917 --> 00:23:43,625For example, I myself was first in Austria then in Germany, so we have quantum storage technology and quantum entanglement control technology. 17600:23:43,792 --> 00:23:51,375We have students who went to Stanford and brought back the best single photon detection technique back to China. 17700:23:51,583 --> 00:23:56,875We also have students who went to Cambridge and brought back the best quantum light source techniques.17800:23:57,333 --> 00:24:06,125At the same time I have colleagues who brought back from Canada and Japan the latest theories on quantum key distribution. 17900:24:06,292 --> 00:24:15,875Because we are a relatively large team whose skills complement each other,18000:24:16,042 --> 00:24:22,833we are able to do things that my supervisor back in Austria, who had a smaller team, could not do. 18100:24:23,042 --> 00:24:29,250This an critical reason why we have come to the forefront of fundamental research in our field.18200:24:29,625 --> 00:24:34,583The third aspect is our project is supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.18300:24:34,750 --> 00:24:42,833If we, for example, need very precise adaptive optics18400:24:43,125 --> 00:24:48,125China has already has been supporting this technology as well as space technology for several years. 18500:24:48,250 --> 00:25:01,042China had dozens of labs in Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, and others just in the field of quantum communications. 18600:25:01,125 --> 00:25:11,708They have joined our group and we now have a new and very complementary group with collective knowledge of many of the latest technologies.18700:25:11,917 --> 00:25:17,125Also because the Chinese economy has been good the past few year18800:25:17,292 --> 00:25:23,708we have been able to ask for a quite substantial amount of funding and thus advance quickly. 18900:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,667So it's almost China's pride19000:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,542Yeah19100:25:29,875 --> 00:25:35,417In what way? In what way is China proud of this project?19200:25:35,583 --> 00:25:45,542In China we are trying to understand approach a satellite launch from a different angle.19300:25:45,958 --> 00:25:54,625Before when we came to science, we've always been following and imitating19400:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,208but very rarely were in at the international forefront. 19500:25:58,333 --> 00:26:08,042Eventually we want China to be running with the rest, and perhaps in some areas lead the way. 19600:26:08,208 --> 00:26:17,167From a certain perspective, when it comes to quantum communication field our satellite has put us in the front of the international footrace. 19700:26:17,292 --> 00:26:26,250So when naming our satellite, after consulting with Chinese colleagues, we decided to name our Satellite Micius. 19800:26:26,375 --> 00:26:34,833Micius was an ancient Chinese philosopher, educator and scientist. 19900:26:35,042 --> 00:26:44,833According to literature he is the first in the world to suggest that light travels in a straight line. 20000:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,083This was something that was not suggested in the West until much later. 20100:26:53,292 --> 00:27:08,333Micius when it came to the study of light, of particles, but others also thought of particle theory too later (Micius was the first to theorise of particles, but it was others after him that thought of particle theory???)20200:27:08,583 --> 00:27:16,000By naming the satellite Micius, we wanted to explain that as long as we have the opportunity to challenge ourselves 20300:27:16,125 --> 00:27:21,042us Chinese people can make meaningful contributions to science.  20400:27:21,167 --> 00:27:27,500We also have another reason, which is that throughout this project we benefited from a flow of international collaboration. 20500:27:27,583 --> 00:27:37,667Therefore, after we finish our first round of scientific missions we are opening our project to scientists from all around the world. 20600:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,167We welcome everyone to work with us. 20700:27:40,333 --> 00:27:46,375We are working toward international collaboration, firstly with Austria's scientific society20800:27:46,667 --> 00:27:54,667to achieve quantum communication between the satellite and Beijing, and between the satellite and Vienna. 20900:27:54,917 --> 00:28:01,333From there we can achieve quantum communication between Vienna and Beijing21000:28:01,458 --> 00:28:07,708We also currently have agreements for collaboration with our German and Italian colleagues. 21100:28:07,875 --> 00:28:17,125We want, with everybodyâ€™s help, work towards advancement in quantum communication science and quantum technology applications. 21200:28:22,333 --> 00:28:34,042When you look at your dream this was a big step you made by sending out the satellite. What are the steps, what are you striving?21300:28:34,292 --> 00:28:41,708If this satellite is a success, we have two further steps to consider. 21400:28:42,083 --> 00:28:50,667This satellite does have the latest technology21500:28:50,792 --> 00:28:55,292If you want to guarantee that the satellite is able to successfully complete its missions21600:28:55,458 --> 00:29:02,458the quality and stability of its engineering is very important. 21700:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,417Currently this satellite can only work at night21800:29:05,583 --> 00:29:11,875because the photon signals are too weak compared to sunlight. 21900:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,292The satellite is only functional at night when there is no sunlight and it is easier to do experiments. 22000:29:20,417 --> 00:29:25,667So the next step is to develop a technology that can make sure we can conduct experiments during daytime too. 22100:29:25,833 --> 00:29:32,333Then we can perform experiments both day and night. 22200:29:32,583 --> 00:29:41,500We need this ability in order to do the experiment I mentioned before with the distance of 300 thousand kilometres. 22300:29:41,667 --> 00:29:56,500Once we have the technology to do experiments throughout the day we want to use it for secure quantum communication22400:29:56,667 --> 00:30:05,625and also link our experiments with the moon landing programme22500:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,333, towards big scale quantum nonlocality validation.22600:30:11,458 --> 00:30:18,250China's moon project could you explain a little bit what this project is? So I can understand what it means?22700:30:18,333 --> 00:30:25,042China's moon landing plan is also called the Chang'e moon landing plan22800:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,833and has already been going on for several years.22900:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,792The first Changâ€™e, I don't remember when it launched23000:30:33,958 --> 00:30:41,250but currently they have a long term plan to send people on the moon in the near future.23100:30:41,375 --> 00:30:50,250When it comes to China's space exploration there are some ambitious plans. 23200:30:50,375 --> 00:30:56,625When it comes to the details, because I am not directly involved23300:30:56,833 --> 00:31:00,375I am not sure about the time scale. 23400:31:00,583 --> 00:31:08,542However they have started to seriously consider sending a satellite to the moon.23500:31:08,708 --> 00:31:17,125We have some equipment on the moon that is working because of Chang'e. 23600:31:17,333 --> 00:31:29,333Chang'e is goddess from a famous Chinese fairy tale who drank an elixir of immortality23700:31:29,458 --> 00:31:37,458and flew to the moon; this is why the programme is called Chang'e.23800:31:38,208 --> 00:31:42,625Chang'e is the first Chinese satellite to orbit the earth.23900:31:42,750 --> 00:31:52,000It later delivered equipment to the moon24000:31:52,417 --> 00:32:01,208The next step is for China to perhaps send a satellite to the far side of the moon to bring back a sample to Earth.24100:32:01,333 --> 00:32:14,667After this mission is complete I estimate that within 10, 15 years China could be able to send people to the moon. 24200:32:17,000 --> 00:32:37,542Looking at your work here in China is it how do the Chinese authorities look at your work? It is very important to be able to conquer space and time?24300:32:37,667 --> 00:32:41,000I think there are many sides to this. 24400:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,542I think everyone is very excited about this. 24500:32:45,667 --> 00:32:55,374Actually this quantum science satellite was launched in the twelfth...China has something called a 5-year plan. 24600:32:55,375 --> 00:33:03,792There is a first 5-year plan, a second... and now we are past the 12th and currently in the 13th 5-year plan24700:33:03,917 --> 00:33:08,417The quantum science satellite is one of the several satellites that were a part of the 12th 5-year plan. 24800:33:08,542 --> 00:33:17,167Despite this being the first quantum science satellite, this is actually the Chinese Academy of Sciences' third science satellite. 24900:33:17,292 --> 00:33:22,583We previously had a dark matter detection satellite25000:33:22,708 --> 00:33:30,375and another, the Shijian-10, to work with microgravity and the life sciences.25100:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,292The third is our quantum satellite. 25200:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,250The reason why people were exited about our quantum satellite was because25300:33:36,417 --> 00:33:39,292firstly, this satellite was the first of its kind. 25400:33:39,417 --> 00:33:43,500So despite it being the third, it was also the first. 25500:33:43,583 --> 00:33:53,208Besides that,  this satellite incorporated techniques that we did not possess before. 25600:33:53,333 --> 00:34:01,167And because were not able to get what we needed from Europe or the US 25700:34:01,292 --> 00:34:07,042this satellite was manufactured with solely Chinese technology. 25800:34:07,167 --> 00:34:16,042With this in mind, we are very happy and satisfied with our technological progress. 25900:34:16,167 --> 00:34:29,125This satellite to our country is to certain degree a symbol26000:34:29,542 --> 00:34:41,125that as time progresses, we are slowly able to do something meaningful. 26100:34:41,208 --> 00:34:51,458We are not only making purely technological progress but we are also contributing to fundamental research. 26200:34:51,667 --> 00:34:59,250We think that China should be able to contribute to global scientific advancement. 26300:34:59,333 --> 00:35:05,875However, we also often hear other sentiments. 26400:35:05,958 --> 00:35:07,875What are they?26500:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,167There are several different ones. 26600:35:09,250 --> 00:35:16,667The first is because quantum entanglement is a very difficult to understand concept. 26700:35:16,750 --> 00:35:24,750Before this kind of concept is universally accepted, those who are not familiar with quantum mechanics26800:35:24,875 --> 00:35:31,083may have doubts or suspicions of whether quantum entanglement is real. 26900:35:31,208 --> 00:35:39,000However within the scientific community there is a general acceptance of quantum entanglement. 27000:35:39,125 --> 00:35:44,500We frequently hear criticisms online of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. 27100:35:44,875 --> 00:35:49,500However, I think with the advancement of science this kind of criticism should slowly dissipate. 27200:35:49,583 --> 00:35:58,875People also are anxious for our technology to become usable. 27300:35:59,042 --> 00:36:01,708Of course we think they should be of use. 27400:36:01,833 --> 00:36:08,458In the near future, we should be able to use quantum key distribution to secure quantum communication between Beijing and Vienna, for example. 27500:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,417But when this would this technology be available to the public so everyone can benefit from this?27600:36:15,500 --> 00:36:21,750I think we need to be patient and wait until we have refined the technology. 27700:36:21,833 --> 00:36:29,333Some people might think that after the satellite launch, we have solved all the problems. 27800:36:29,458 --> 00:36:34,417This is something that we often need to explain, that we need to wait, we need to have patience27900:36:34,542 --> 00:36:36,667We have to wait for technology to improve. 28000:36:38,458 --> 00:36:48,208What kind of other applications can you imagine that are ahead for us with quantum mechanics and all the developments that are going on?28100:36:48,292 --> 00:37:02,000The first thing, as I mentioned earlier, is to increase the security of our communication and our cyber security. 28200:37:02,167 --> 00:37:08,333The second is to use the developed technology to can see an image from very far away. 28300:37:08,458 --> 00:37:22,750We  can use quantum imaging to  from explore earth's resources (?). 28400:37:23,125 --> 00:37:28,000So far it seems these are the two main applications. 28500:37:28,167 --> 00:37:31,500In the a long term there are some interesting plans28600:37:31,667 --> 00:37:39,750to use the quantum entanglement distribution in space and have two clocks on Earth synchronise. 28700:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,792I'm talking about quantum clock synchronisation. 28800:37:42,917 --> 00:37:45,625We only have theorised about this. 28900:37:45,750 --> 00:37:52,250Mikhail Lukin from Harvard have recently published some interesting articles29000:37:52,375 --> 00:38:02,875in which he proposes that we can use free space quantum engagement distribution to achieve two clock synchronisation on Earth. 29100:38:02,917 --> 00:38:09,750Everyone knows that this clock synchronisation would be very useful when it comes to GPS navigation. 29200:38:09,875 --> 00:38:16,917So aside from communication there will be also real life uses in imaging and time synchronisation. 29300:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,292Hopefully an answer to the theory of everything. 29400:38:22,500 --> 00:38:31,208Yes but it's a long-term project that will probably take another twenty years29500:38:31,625 --> 00:38:32,792Maybe you can say that in Chinese?29600:38:32,917 --> 00:38:40,083That is of course our most ambitious thought.29700:38:40,208 --> 00:38:49,500If us Chinese scientists are able to investigate and contribute to the theory of everything29800:38:49,667 --> 00:38:53,208it would something to be proud of. 29900:38:53,333 --> 00:38:58,000This would, according to our colleague Tony Leggett,30000:38:58,083 --> 00:39:02,333take 30 years, or perhaps 100 years. 30100:39:02,458 --> 00:39:09,958However we are more inclined to believe that it won't take that long, it wont take a 100 years. 30200:39:10,083 --> 00:39:18,625I very much believe that within my lifetime I will we able to witness the ultimate proof of the theory of quantum nonlocality; 30300:39:18,833 --> 00:39:27,000perhaps in 15 years or perhaps in 20, but at least much shorter than 100 hundreds. 30400:39:27,125 --> 00:39:31,458It's magic right? Thereâ€™s something magical about it30500:39:31,583 --> 00:39:44,250And when you look at your personal dream, how do you envision the dreams you still have?30600:39:44,792 --> 00:39:52,208My dream is not the about the application of quantum technologies. 30700:39:52,375 --> 00:40:12,750My dream is to do fundamental research and to work on and contribute to the theory of everything.30800:40:12,875 --> 00:40:22,083A great wish of mine is to discover through experimentation with quantum entanglement 30900:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,583why quantum entanglement exists. 31000:40:24,042 --> 00:40:28,042When I was learning about quantum physics31100:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,625at first i had some difficulties(?)31200:40:29,750 --> 00:40:34,875Afterwards I learned about Einsteinâ€™s' work on quantum entanglement31300:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,125deep in my heart, even though there is innumerable proof that Einstein's thoughts were wrong and even though31400:40:42,208 --> 00:40:49,500experiments with quantum mechanics again and again disprove Einsteinâ€™s theory on the principle of locality, 31500:40:49,583 --> 00:40:56,000deep in my heart I want to do experiments that could perhaps go on to prove that on a higher level31600:40:56,208 --> 00:41:04,333we come back to a variation of Einstein's principle of locality theory. 31700:41:04,958 --> 00:41:10,708So in my heart I am still a believer in the principle of locality and I hope to do something in this field. 31800:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,833Yet I donâ€™t know if I can do discover something new within my lifetime. 31900:41:14,917 --> 00:41:20,917Those are my wishes; I think that us scientists spend so much money32000:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,542in hopes that the technologies we make are of some use and so we push it towards to it being used. 32100:41:27,667 --> 00:41:33,542I hope that these technologies can be put to good use in the future 32200:41:33,667 --> 00:41:44,125like in  secure communication, or in imaging, or in clock synchronisation. 32300:41:44,208 --> 00:41:49,083Then, to the general public their investment in scientists32400:41:49,375 --> 00:41:55,333is not in vain and they will give us even more money to let us spend on fundamental research. 32500:42:02,292 --> 00:42:10,333You were talking about quantum entanglement. I know I asked you before, but could you explain again what is quantum entanglement?32600:42:10,458 --> 00:42:21,708Quantum entanglement is actually is an embodiment of the theory of quantum superposition multi-particle system.32700:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,417What does that mean?32800:42:24,500 --> 00:42:30,875I'll give an example: to simplify this lets assume there are only two states. 32900:42:31,042 --> 00:42:35,375There is something we call spin, and it can be in a state of either up or down33000:42:35,458 --> 00:42:42,917If we have two particles, according to quantum mechanics, a particles in superposition has a spin33100:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,667state of either up or down. 33200:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,583This can occur simultaneously. 33300:42:47,958 --> 00:42:52,125So if there are two particles, it will exists in a strange state of being. 33400:42:52,417 --> 00:42:59,458Mathematically speaking, I will say it will be spin up up plus spin down down. 33500:42:59,792 --> 00:43:07,333So if there are two particles, one in Shanghai and the other in the Netherlands, 33600:43:07,625 --> 00:43:12,042and at this moment if we measure the particles, we discover that33700:43:12,292 --> 00:43:21,583if you find that one particle has a upward spin, then the other particle will also have an upward spin. 33900:43:21,833 --> 00:43:28,458If you find that one particle has a downward spin, then the other particle will also have a downward spin. 34000:43:28,792 --> 00:43:33,042It seems that everyone thinks this is strange, but you can repeat this experiment many times34100:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,917and you can send many pairs of entangled particles to different places34200:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,125but every time the result, if the particles are in an entangled state, 34300:43:39,292 --> 00:43:43,250will be that either both particles have an upward spin, or both have a downward spin. 34400:43:43,458 --> 00:43:52,042Einstein called this strange phenomenon "spooky action at a distance."34500:43:52,292 --> 00:43:59,000This is what we mean when we talk about quantum entanglement. 34600:44:01,500 --> 00:44:21,917And when you look around now, can you see quantum mechanics working, are there machines, are there topics that somehow prove quantum mechanics?34700:44:22,250 --> 00:44:29,583Up until now we have proven quantum mechanics is correct through many experiments. 34800:44:29,750 --> 00:44:37,458We have concrete examples like superconducting phenomena, nuclear energy,34900:44:37,667 --> 00:44:47,583nuclear magnetic resonance, giant magnetoresistance  and other35000:44:47,667 --> 00:44:53,458and other examples from various scientific fields that prove quantum mechanics works very well. 35100:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,042That it is correct. 35200:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,542When it comes to detailed experiments into quantum mechanics35300:44:58,667 --> 00:45:03,125,what we call fundamental research into quantum mechanics, 35400:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,833we often use quantum entanglement as an example. 35500:45:09,042 --> 00:45:18,125After quantum SchrÃ¶dinger and Einstein proposed entanglement in 1935,35600:45:18,417 --> 00:45:24,833people  started doing experiments with it in the 70â€™s 35700:45:25,000 --> 00:45:34,583The earliest experiments were conducted by Clauser and his colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley. 35800:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,208Later it was France's Alain Aspect35900:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,917who also did experiments in this field. 36000:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,292Successively they proved the existence of quantum entanglement. 36100:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,667But some people say there are gaps within these experiments. 36200:45:48,958 --> 00:45:52,583What I want to prove is "spooky action at a distance"36300:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,458because then you guarantee that during the experiments the condition of locality is met. 36400:46:01,542 --> 00:46:12,917The locality loophole was shut down in the 90's Weihs'(?) team in Innsbruck.   36500:46:13,208 --> 00:46:17,583Everyone then suggested the the detection loophole. 36600:46:17,917 --> 00:46:25,000Well, last year the detection loophole was closed by Dutch scientists36700:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,000who also simultaneously closed the locality loophole. 36800:46:28,167 --> 00:46:38,083Thus we are left with the final loophole, the freedom of choice loophole which is also called the collapse locality loophole. 36900:46:38,375 --> 00:46:45,250We hope to close this loophole within the next 10, 20 years.37000:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,708All the experiments until now already proved quantum mechanics works37100:46:50,917 --> 00:46:56,500but quantum mechanics at long distance, and this final loophole, can they also be solved?37200:46:56,708 --> 00:46:58,292Well we don't know that now. 37300:46:58,417 --> 00:47:00,000In the future there are two possibilities37400:47:00,167 --> 00:47:04,333I think it is a great possibility is that we we go on prove quantum mechanics is correct37500:47:04,625 --> 00:47:06,250and we close all the loopholes. 37600:47:06,458 --> 00:47:12,167But there is also a small possibility that we discover a new field of physics. 37700:47:12,458 --> 00:47:16,125Then it will get very exciting for us.37800:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,375Both can be exciting.37900:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,500Right38000:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,250What kind of other theories that can be found when you fantasize about that?38100:47:28,708 --> 00:47:34,833I think throughout this process, when we are talking about the validation of quantum mechanics nonlocality38200:47:35,417 --> 00:47:42,000it is still very fundamental, still the foundations of of quantum mechanics.38300:47:42,333 --> 00:47:45,667The next step would be what I mentioned before:38400:47:45,833 --> 00:47:50,750we can test quantum gravity models. 38500:47:50,917 --> 00:47:55,917This would be what we would do after we finish our second mission. 38600:47:56,083 --> 00:48:03,542Afterwards, theoretical physicists are very smart38700:48:03,792 --> 00:48:06,125and they will propose all sorts of models. 38800:48:06,292 --> 00:48:09,250But each model the propose will be consistent with the natural world38900:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,167and  while some scientists will say that's good enough39000:48:11,542 --> 00:48:13,792this is when we need to do experiments. 39100:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,083We wish that when we finish proving quantum mechanics nonlocality 39200:48:20,292 --> 00:48:29,208we will come back and to experimental research work in quantum gravity related theories and models. 39300:48:29,375 --> 00:48:36,375And quantum gravity, could you explain that? What is quantum gravity?39400:48:37,625 --> 00:48:42,417I am not really qualified to discuss quantum gravity because this theory39500:48:43,250 --> 00:48:48,708is something (theoretical physicists like) Hawking and other scientists have suggested. 39600:48:48,875 --> 00:48:54,625To an experimental physicists like me I just know that that they took quantum theory39700:48:54,875 --> 00:49:00,625and gravity theory and combined them. 39800:49:00,875 --> 00:49:04,583After they were combined they proposed several further theories39900:49:04,875 --> 00:49:09,500but which of them is the one congruent with our natural universe?40000:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,583This needs to be proved with experiments. 40100:49:11,708 --> 00:49:17,083When we do the experiments do the predictions from the theories align with our experimental results?40200:49:17,208 --> 00:49:24,208The ones that match up are the ones that are more likely to approximate natural law. 40300:49:24,625 --> 00:49:34,917Because I am not an expert in quantum gravity, I can't elaborate on or criticise the models40400:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,750Thank you
