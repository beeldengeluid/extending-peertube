100:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000(interviewer) So what did we do, just a moment ago?200:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000We are now in a duck trap facility at Oud-Alblas.300:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000We have a longstanding practice of catching wild ducks here, for our research on flu viruses.400:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000These wild ducks are actually the natural hosts of flu viruses.500:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000The viruses are completely harmless to them...600:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000because these viruses evolved for millions of years in sync with birds.700:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000We can catch these birds quite easily here.800:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000Once they are caught we take samples of their cloacas and throaths.900:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000These viruses proliferate quickly in the respiratory system, both in humans and birds.1000:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000However, in birds they also proliferate in the stomach and intestines.1100:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000By taking samples we can identify these flu viruses in wild birds.1200:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,280(interviewer) What is your affinity with viruses?1300:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280Viruses are fascinating organisms.1400:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,280In particular because they are so small, you cannot see them.1500:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,280Viruses are incredibly diverse. Every human, plant, animal, mold, bacterium, they all have their own viruses...1600:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280dozens of different viruses per species.1700:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,280The diversity of viruses exceeds the diversity in nature we normally observe with our bare eyes.1800:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,280Viruses evolve, just like humans and animals do.1900:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,280However, viruses evolve quickly, so we can actually study evolution by studying viruses.2000:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280And this is what my research group is mainly doing.2100:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,280They are interested in understanding how evolution works, in particular in viruses, in my case flu viruses.2200:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,280(interviewer) When people think of viruses, they usually think: oops, dangerous, or even deadly.2300:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280Yes, well, most of the viruses we find in nature are completely harmless.2400:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,280Me myself, and all other humans, we are constantly hosting viruses that do not harm us.2500:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,280This is also the case for plants, molds, bacteria...2600:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280Most viruses are completely harmless.2700:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,280The viruses in wild birds that we study are harmless to them...2800:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400That does not mean that viruses are totally innocuous.2900:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,360We see, for example, that viruses in wild ducks can cross into poultry.3000:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,240They may evolve in poultry to more dangerous variants, that eventually kills chickens and turkeys.3100:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,240(interviewer) Are viruses a kind of conquerors of the world? Would that be a correct way to put it?3200:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,240Viruses did not really conquer the world. Actually, we conquered the world after the viruses.3300:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,240The theory is that viruses are the basis of life.3400:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,760Bacteria, molds, and the higher organisms have evolved from viral elements.3500:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,760Actually, viruses are the basis of contemporary life.3600:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,760We conquered the world at the expense of the viruses.3700:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760(interviewer) But we are in a constant battle with them.3800:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,760Yes, there are constant new threaths and new viruses that cross between hosts.3900:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,760For example, from wild birds to poultry, or from poultry to humans.4000:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,760When viruses change hosts, we can discern some regularity in the problems that occur.4100:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,760We see that in flu viruses, but also in Zika and Ebola viruses.4200:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,760We have seen large pandemonia of viruses that were harmless for their natural hosts.4300:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,760But when they cross into a new host... new hosts are not really adapted to them, which causes trouble.4400:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,760(interviewer) They can cause really big trouble, right?4500:03:56,760 --> 00:04:05,760Yes, most viruses are completely harmless, but we know that some families cause trouble.4600:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,360Especially when they cross from animal to human. The recent Ebola outbreak is a good example...4700:04:14,360 --> 00:04:23,360Because the 'case fatality rate', the likeliness of death occuring in case of infection, was between 50%-90%.4800:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,360But the good thing of the Ebola virus is that it does not proliferate well among humans.4900:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360And therefore there was no global outbreak, while other viruses can actually instantiate this.5000:04:35,360 --> 00:04:46,360Flu viruses are an example: if they cross to humans, and if they can proliferate among them, then we see a pandemonium.5100:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,360That is a global epidemic, we have seen that in 2009 with the Mexican flu, and the swine flu that crossed to humans.5200:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,360Within a few months it was spread throughout the entire world.5300:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,400It is not as deadly as Ebola, but the epidemic killed at least 200.000 humans.5400:05:09,400 --> 00:05:21,400(interviewer) Your lab is mainly working with this kind of viruses, but what is it that renders your lab a state-of-the-art lab?5500:05:22,400 --> 00:05:30,400The big difference with other labs is that in our lab, viruses are studied from begin to end.5600:05:31,400 --> 00:05:40,400We start studying wild birds, the evolution and adaption of viruses to these birds, their crossing to poultry...5700:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,400And how they cause problems there. We study the crossing from poulty to humans...5800:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,400what kind of evolution processes are relevant there, and we study how viruses evolve in humans.5900:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,400We see them returning every year in epidemics, they keep mutating, so that we constantly have to adapt our vaccines.6000:06:04,400 --> 00:06:16,400We study all facets of evolution: in nature with wild birds, in the lab, by imitating viruses with molecular techniques...6100:06:17,400 --> 00:06:28,400but also with genetic modification and in the lab with animal experiments. So actually the entire field from the natural origins...6200:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,400to studying the molecular process in the smallest details, is what distinguishes our lab.6300:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,960(interviewer) I also understood that you have a large archive?6400:06:40,400 --> 00:06:52,400Yes, we have build archives throughout the years. Rotterdam has employed virologists that work on viruses for more than 50 years.6500:06:53,400 --> 00:07:01,400The collection in our deep freezers dates back to the '30s, '40s, the time of prof. Mulder and prof. Masurel.6600:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,400They are still being updated. So also for bird flu, swine flu, human flu... we have an enormous collection of viruses.6700:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,400(interviewer) And if you have to explain in a few words what your research is about?6800:07:18,480 --> 00:07:33,480My research focuses on the evolution of flu viruses: when they adapt to new hosts, and when they try to escape our immune system.6900:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480That is the core of my research.7000:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,480(interviewer) Some time ago you studied the proliferation of viruses, you even made a virus yourself...7100:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,480(interviewer) Can you describe what happened in August 2011?7200:07:48,480 --> 00:07:56,520In the summer of 2011, we discovered that the H5N1 bird flu virus, which is highly pathogenic and deadly for chickens...7300:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,520Could be transmitted between mammals via the respiratory system.7400:08:04,520 --> 00:08:14,520This kind of transmission through the air is what happens normally in pandemonia, so we tried to understand that...7500:08:15,520 --> 00:08:23,520By looking at this bird flu virus. But this is a relatively dangerous flu virus. We manipulated the virus...7600:08:24,520 --> 00:08:33,520In well-secured labs, of course, and it became not only pathogenic but also transmissible.7700:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,520This was remarkable, because it was the first demonstration of how a bird flu virus...7800:08:39,520 --> 00:08:52,520Becomes transmissible between mammals. We were eager to publish our results. But during the peer-review process...7900:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,520The viruses we manipulated were evaluated as being too susceptible to misuse by terrorists, for biological weapons.8000:09:01,520 --> 00:09:13,440The US government tried to withhold the publication of our data, method and results.8100:09:14,440 --> 00:09:23,440This should not be possible in science. We work in a transparent environment, so we share our results with our fellow scientists...8200:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,920to help propagate science further, and to prevent the outbreak of pandemic viruses in the future.8300:09:32,920 --> 00:09:41,920The only way to do that is by sharing all information, by cooperation, and understanding how these viral transmissions work.8400:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,920Subsequently there were global discussions that not only the Americans had to be aware of this issue...8500:09:50,920 --> 00:10:04,920But also the World Health Organisation. In 2012 they recommended to publish our study in all its glory...8600:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,920So that the field of virology and flu research would be able to thrive.8700:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920(interviewer) But this was not quite a convenient period for you.8800:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,920Indeed, it had quite some impact. If a government thinks that you are in possession of a biological weapon...8900:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,920Then intelligence services will come by, security services, to ensure that the virus stays in the lab.9000:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,920But it is not a weapon, it is an object of scientific inquiry. The virulency and transmissibility...9100:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,920are being exaggerated by the lay media. But meausures were taken. You are being secured...9200:10:47,920 --> 00:10:56,920The deep freezer files were protected, computers were screened, too see whether terrorists looked over your shoulder9300:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920As a scientist, you seldom have experiences like this, and you do not want to have them again.9400:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920(interview) It influenced your private life directly as well.9500:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,920It influences your private life, yes. For example, we had to travel all around the globe...9600:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,640To meet the World Health Organisation, the US government. This means being away from home a lot.9700:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,640And if you are at home, with wife and children, the police is patrolling your street to check up on you.9800:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640(interviewer) Is this still bothering you?9900:11:31,640 --> 00:11:48,640No, since the summer of 2012 it is quiet. There are still global discussions about the topic, and about changing laws...10000:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,640but my private life is quiet again.10100:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,720(interview) But I understood that in this period, you were also threatened.10200:11:58,720 --> 00:12:11,720Yes, on internet there were people threatening me and my family, saying things one wouldn't wish to one's enemy.10300:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720(interviewer) What is it that makes people react so ferociously?10400:12:16,960 --> 00:12:28,960Most people lack understanding of this subject. The American media said that we made a biological weapon...10500:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,960and that if it would escape my lab, half of the world's population would cease to exist within months.10600:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,960If you spread this kind of false information, then I can imagine that people become uneasy.10700:12:46,960 --> 00:12:54,960The fact that we were not allowed to share our data caused a disproportional exaggeration of our research...10800:12:55,960 --> 00:13:02,960in the American press, and that trickles down to The Netherlands. And some lay men think...10900:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,960that they have enough knowledge of the facts, while these facts are not even on the table.11000:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,960But they apparently know enough of these facts to call to harm me.11100:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960(interviewer) What are your reflections on that period?11200:13:16,960 --> 00:13:27,960It was an incredibly worrisome time in my academic career. One of my biggest scientific successes...11300:13:28,960 --> 00:13:37,960Evokes so much controversy, that one almost thinks that not having that success would have been better.11400:13:38,960 --> 00:13:55,960It was a worrisome period. Yet, we learned a lot from it, it stimulated our research, that would not have been possible otherwise.11500:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,960(interviewer) A new lab has been built. It is extremely well-secured, isn't it?11600:14:02,960 --> 00:14:17,960Yes, because of public uneasiness about viruses, the attention by the lay press and politicians.11700:14:18,960 --> 00:14:29,960You see that in the last 10 years the rules concerning biosafety and biosecurity in labs are becoming more strict.11800:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,960The terrorist attacks in the US contributed to this development. My research funds are mainly coming from the US.11900:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,960Which means that I have to comply to the US rules, and these are becoming more strict.12000:14:42,960 --> 00:14:57,960The result is that I am working in a bunker, to keep dangerous people out. It is inconvenient, but apparently necessary.12100:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960(interviewer) But security measures are also necessary to keep the virus in the lab.12200:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,960Yes, we work under biosafety and biosecurity conditions.12300:15:06,960 --> 00:15:13,960Biosafety means keeping dangerous viruses in the lab, biosecurity means keeping dangerous people out.12400:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,960We do not want our lab workers to become infected. Fortunately this is kind of impossible in our lab...12500:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,960because of all these layers of biosafety management, we can guarantee the security of our employees.12600:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,960Experiments are conducted in hermetically sealed cabinets. Our people are protected from infections.12700:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,960(interviewer) You have a top-notch laboratory, the lab is globally acknowledged, why is that?12800:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,960I think that the multidisciplinary character of our research in Rotterdam...12900:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960(interviewer) Sorry, let me please ask the question again.13000:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,960(interviewer) Your lab is globally acknowledged, what is the reason behind this?13100:16:06,960 --> 00:16:13,960I think that especially the multidisciplinarity of our research is quite unmatched.13200:16:14,960 --> 00:16:23,960We have experts in the ecology of wild animals, who observe animals in the wild...13300:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,960but we also have pathologists, animal experimenters, molecular bioligists, geneticists...13400:16:32,960 --> 00:16:42,960All this expertise merges in our research group, which allows us to answer all questions in virology. This renders us unique.13500:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,960(interviewer) Is your assistance demanded in case of trouble?13600:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,960Yes, there are virus outbreaks somewhere on the globe every year, or every few years...13700:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,960last year in the Netherlands in poultry, we had a H5N8 bird flu outbreak.13800:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,960But we are also called-for in case of trouble in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Georgia...13900:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,960to assist the locals in answering research questions, but we also provide advice...14000:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,960in case of an outbreak. We are happy to do that, we do it a lot, almost every year.14100:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,960(interviewer) So is your research carried out secretly, or is it public?14200:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,960The research of my group is completely public, we work in academics, not in an army base.14300:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,960We work with scientists and students from across the globe, this means that our research...14400:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,960is carried out transparently. From the start, that is, from annoucing experiments, applying for funds...14500:17:51,960 --> 00:17:59,960to publication, and giving lectures. Every detail will be shared and communicated to the rest of the world.14600:18:01,960 --> 00:18:10,960(interviewer) If we look to the future, what will be the role of viruses? How can we control them?14700:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,960Well, viruses prove to be quite comprehensible after a bit of research.14800:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,960After 25 years of research on AIDS, we can treat AIDS with anti-viral medicines.14900:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,960(interviewer) Let us wait for the plane to pass... So, if we look to the future...15000:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,960(interviewer) what can we expect of viruses in the future? In what way can we use them?15100:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,960A sufficient amount of research allows us to control viruses.15200:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,960We eradicated some global viruses already: smallpox for example, does not exist anymore.15300:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,960Other infectious diseases are treatable quite well, like AIDS, or hepatitis.15400:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,960We anticipate flu viruses with vaccins, but they are not yet functioning optimal.15500:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,960They provide at best 80% protection. But my research group and others around the globe are working very hard...15600:19:14,960 --> 00:19:24,960to design vaccins that provide 100% protection, and protect you from all other flu variants found in nature.15700:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,960If we have those, then in principle there is no need to die because of the flu.15800:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960(interviewer) But can we predict the evolution of these viruses?15900:19:37,960 --> 00:19:47,960Flu viruses, just like many other viruses, evolve incredibly fast. You become resilient to them...16000:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,960but after a few years, you will see that the virus can infect you again because it secretly changed a little bit.16100:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,960This is why viruses return every winter; despite your earlier infections and resilience, they have changed slightly...16200:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,960relative to your last infection. So once in, say, 10 years, you become infected.16300:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,960We are currently researching whether we can make vaccins for the most conserved outer parts of viruses...16400:20:21,960 --> 00:20:31,960so that the virus cannot escape anymore. We try to target the crucial proteins, that are so crucial...16500:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,960that when you change them, the virus will become crippled. We are currently working hard on that.16600:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,960So hopefully, this will stop viruses from escaping our immune system.16700:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960(interviewer) What will all of this mean for us?16800:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,960That the groups that face risks, and are vaccinated pre-emptively, people with asthma, diabetes, elderly people...16900:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,960That they do not need to die because of the flu. We see that flu epidemics every year and world wide...17000:21:05,960 --> 00:21:14,960result in about 500 million casualties, that is quite a number. In principle this is preventable in the future.17100:21:17,960 --> 00:21:25,960People with this kind of vaccin against flu, but also other respiratory problems, will become much older.17200:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960And perhaps most important, they will also be healthier in their longer lives.17300:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,960(interviewer) Can we redo the last part? What will all of this mean for us?17400:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,960All those patients that are suffering diabetes...17500:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,960These birds are quite noisy, they even produce more noise than I can!17600:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,960(interviewer) We are not only conquering the world of the viruses but also with the viruses, right?17700:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,960Yes, the growth of knowledge in virology enables us to use viruses to increase public heath.17800:22:36,960 --> 00:22:44,960The AIDS-virus, HIV, is well understood. We know exactly which parts of it we can remove, replace...17900:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,960so that the virus becomes completely innocuous, and usable as vehicle.18000:22:51,960 --> 00:23:01,960The AIDS-virus is used to cure patients with immune deficiencies. These people have a defective gene...18100:23:02,960 --> 00:23:11,960And by using a HIV-virus that carries a correct copy of that gene, we can cure people with viruses..18200:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960viruses that would have killed us 25 years ago.18300:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,960Similar attempts are made to use viruses against cancer, to repair other gen deficiencies...18400:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,960or to use them as medicine-carriers, that can deliver medicines to exact locations in human bodies.18500:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,960(interviewer) So you are kind of using the natural properties of viruses.18600:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,960Yes, the diversity of viruses is enormous. They all have their own particular properties...18700:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,960and we can pick the viruses with the properties that are most benificient for us.18800:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,960Then we manipulate the viruses so that they become harmless to us...18900:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,960but at the same time keep the properties that we need to transport genes or medicines to specific locations.19000:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,960(interviewer) So you use viruses to transport genes to exact locations? How does that work?19100:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,960A virus is basically a globule of fat, which contains genetic material. We can manipulate that.19200:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,960We can remove non-essential parts, but we can also remove the infective parts...19300:24:33,960 --> 00:24:43,960the removed parts can be replaced with genes of interest. For example, a correct gene for a defective one.19400:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960(interviewer) And that means a cure?19500:24:48,960 --> 00:24:58,960Then we infect the patient with a virus, that we rendered harmless, actually a virus that cures you...19600:24:59,960 --> 00:25:09,960because it will multiply in your cells, and will inject a correct version of a gen where there used to be deficiences.19700:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,960(interviewer) This is quite a special future for humans and viruses, isn't it?19800:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,960The technology is actually still in its infancy, for we have been working for more than 25 years...19900:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,960on gene therapy, viral vehicles, to cure people. The last few years there has been an enourmous development...20000:25:34,960 --> 00:25:43,960with viruses that are totally harmless to humans and animals, and that are easy to produce and inject.20100:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,960Viruses that we can use to cure patients that are seriously ill. Hopefully in the future also for cancer.20200:25:50,960 --> 00:25:58,960Currently the first cancer medicines are available, but these do not work for some aggresive types...20300:25:59,960 --> 00:26:10,960prostate cancer, brain tumors. We are working hard on this: manipulating viruses to cure these diseases.20400:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,960(interviewer) So if you look to your field of inquiry, what are your wildest dreams?20500:26:19,960 --> 01:05:27,960That ultimately, we will be able to become older in a healthy way. So that means...20600:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,960without infections of the resipiratory system, without cancer.20700:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,960We will achieve that, in the coming decennia.20800:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,960Among other things, we will achieve this by using the viruses that used to infect us.20900:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,960But by all these manipulations, they will rather cure us in the future. We can use them...21000:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,960as vehicles for vaccins, as therapy for cancer, and other genetic deficiences.
