100:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,433Can you tell me about the beauty of viruses?200:00:04,733 --> 00:00:07,533Viruses are definitely facinating.300:00:07,567 --> 00:00:13,933If you go out into nature you'll see plants, animals, bacteria, fungi...400:00:14,167 --> 00:00:21,967What you don't see is that they all carry viruses, not just one but multiple viruses.500:00:22,067 --> 00:00:28,800So the biodiversity of viruses is much higher than the biodiversity of things you can see with your bare eyes.600:00:28,967 --> 00:00:34,633These viruses all look different, they belong to large families.700:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,833But if you look at them with an electron microscope you'll see800:00:38,267 --> 00:00:48,367beautiful symmetrical structures, little bars or sometimes ugly polymorfic creatures.900:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,400What is special about these virusses is that most of their hosts don't become ill, don't die.1000:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,633The viruses are completely innocent.1100:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,633However there are a limited number of viruses that can do significant damage to their host.1200:01:07,900 --> 00:01:16,767It's special that such a tiny creature, in a large organism like an elephant, can cause so much damage.1300:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,433Are they living creatures? Is it life?1400:01:22,133 --> 00:01:29,300Viruses have genetic material, in that sense they are the same as bacteria,1500:01:29,367 --> 00:01:33,767fungi, plants or animals, but formally they are not alive1600:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,567because they don't have their own metabolic system.1700:01:36,767 --> 00:01:42,500They are completely dependent on a host for multiplying their genetic material.1800:01:42,567 --> 00:01:47,867So they are not alive, but based on their genetic material they are oganisms.1900:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,100Why are you so facinated by viruses?2000:01:51,500 --> 00:02:00,067Viruses are incredibly diverse, in nature you can see plants, animals and fungi2100:02:00,167 --> 00:02:04,133which look beautiful, very diverse, but you might not realize2200:02:04,333 --> 00:02:10,600all those organisms carry viruses, multiple viruses for every host.2300:02:10,667 --> 00:02:17,033So the biodiversity of viruses is much larger than you can see with you bare eyes.2400:02:17,767 --> 00:02:24,067Most of those viruses don't cause any trouble for their host,2500:02:24,333 --> 00:02:32,833it's a very limited number of viruses that cause illness or death in their host.2600:02:33,267 --> 00:02:44,433But it's admirable that such a tiny invisible organism is capable of killing, say, an elepant.2700:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,533Could you say the earth is more or less populated by viruses?2800:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,233Yes, viruses are so diverse you could state the earth actually belongs to them.2900:02:58,433 --> 00:03:11,367Some theories of evolution say all life on earth comes from tiny bits of multiplying genetic material,3000:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,333which in fact is a virus. So viruses are the foundation for all life on earth.3100:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,867That is one of the prevalent theories within evolutionary theory.3200:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,433And there are clear indications for this.3300:03:25,667 --> 00:03:33,367A large part of human genetic material consists of elements that once used to be viruses.3400:03:33,867 --> 00:03:37,467Those viruses played an important role in the evolution of humans,3500:03:37,733 --> 00:03:47,200the fact that women have a placenta is because of former virusses.3600:03:47,433 --> 00:03:50,167So the placenta only came into existence3700:03:50,333 --> 00:03:55,767because of a virus that entered the genetic material of an organism.3800:03:56,067 --> 00:04:04,067Thus viruses are a vital part of the evolution of everything on earth.3900:04:04,367 --> 00:04:08,467You could say viruses conquered the world.4000:04:09,033 --> 00:04:13,833That's comlicated, something of a chicken and egg situation.4100:04:14,033 --> 00:04:18,000First there were viruses, then something bigger evolved.4200:04:18,333 --> 00:04:24,733So in fact humans conquered the world using those viruses.4300:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,633I think that's a more correct understanding of what happened.4400:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,767We defeated viruses and conquered the world.4500:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,800We are alive thanks to the existence of viruses4600:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,067thanks to viruses we are what we are,4700:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,200plants and animals are what they are.4800:04:42,633 --> 00:04:48,100But we can now handle viruses4900:04:48,867 --> 00:04:53,667combat them with medication, vaccines and preventive measures.5000:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,467So we are conquering the viruses, yes.5100:04:58,033 --> 00:05:02,167What was your personal motive to start working on viruses?5200:05:03,433 --> 00:05:10,667I graduated in 1984, when it was discovered HIV was the cause of AIDS.5300:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,967And I was handed a job I simply couldn't refuse.5400:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,667Up until that moment we thought we had beaten the world of viruses,5500:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,767we eliminated smallpox, we were busy eliminating measles,5600:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,400we actually thought viruses would dissapear. But then there was AIDS5700:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,233and after that hepatitis and other substantial viral infections.5800:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,033So I got the chance to work on AIDS,5900:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,533which I did with great joy for the first 10 years of my career.6000:05:45,833 --> 00:05:50,433But after those 10 years, after lots of basic research,6100:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,000people with AIDS could live,6200:05:54,867 --> 00:06:00,733we can't completely cure it yet, but we can prevent an early death from AIDS.6300:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,567That gave me the feeling that my work,6400:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,500the basic virology reasearch on AIDS, was done6500:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,567and I should start doing something else,6600:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,700so I started working on a respiratory virus.6700:06:12,267 --> 00:06:19,533Why do you think you lab is considered to be one of the best in the world?6800:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,700That's by virtue of the vision of the professors that used to run the lab6900:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,900it's been a virology department for a long time.7000:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,667At first run by professor Mulder, Masurel and Osterhaus7100:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,133and they brought together a very diverse team, it's multidisciplinary,7200:06:42,467 --> 00:06:52,900has ecologists, pathologists, immunologists, virologists, all working together.7300:06:53,267 --> 00:06:58,367They are all relatively young and very enthusiastic people7400:06:58,733 --> 00:07:03,167together they can analyse any problem,7500:07:03,233 --> 00:07:08,167they have all the tools that are needed to do virology research.7600:07:08,333 --> 00:07:13,567That's owing to 50 years of virology lab in Rotterdam.7700:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,933You have a large archive and a new laboratory7800:07:17,733 --> 00:07:26,900We have an extensive collection of viruses, from humans and animals, dating back to 1930.7900:07:27,233 --> 00:07:35,500We have a great number of freezers filled with samples of viruses.8000:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,500And we use those for lots of research.8100:07:37,733 --> 00:07:43,367There are wild animals, birds, bats and zoo animals,8200:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,033we once studied the serengeti lion, those kind of things.8300:07:48,167 --> 00:07:56,467Additionally we have facilities that allow us to work with pathogenic viruses8400:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,700you can't just bring out to work with.8500:08:00,067 --> 00:08:06,200We built special labs, so called BSL3 labs, biosafety level three,8600:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,100where you can safely work with the viruses, without the risc of infection8700:08:12,633 --> 00:08:17,800and without the risc of villains stealing a virus.8800:08:18,233 --> 00:08:21,167The laboratories are protected in two ways.8900:08:21,367 --> 00:08:27,400And there we can research the viruses using both cell and tissue culture systems9000:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,767and test animals.9100:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,567You want to keep the viruses in and malevolent people out.9200:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,167Yes, in our labs we have two forms of safety: biosafety and biosecurity.9300:08:43,533 --> 00:08:49,967Biosafety means keeping dangerous viruses away from people.9400:08:50,333 --> 00:08:57,233Biosecurity means keeping dangerous people away from viruses, to prevent abuse.9500:08:58,133 --> 00:09:05,733You work on respiratory viruses, what kind of research do you do exactly?9600:09:06,367 --> 00:09:13,733Our research covers everything from the very beginning of the viruses to the end.9700:09:14,033 --> 00:09:24,367My research is about the evolution of these viruses, so we start with their natural hosts, birds9800:09:24,567 --> 00:09:31,367we do field studies and try to understand the evolution and spread of these viruses in birds.9900:09:31,500 --> 00:09:41,533Some of the viruses can spread to poultry, we try to understand why some can and others can not.10000:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,967If we know the answer we might be able to prevent outbreaks.10100:09:47,867 --> 00:09:54,300In poultry the H5 en H7 influenza viruses can evolve into highly pathogenic forms10200:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,533that cause death chickens within 24 hours.10300:09:58,867 --> 00:10:06,367We have no idea how it works. Why is it just these two viruses and why is it just in chickens?10400:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,633We try to understand the evolution so we can do something with that knowledge.10500:10:11,933 --> 00:10:18,033Once poultry has been infected, it can be transmitted to pigs.10600:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,600When livestock is infected, it can spread to humans.10700:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,567You can see evolution processes, how a virus adapts to it's new host, a human.10800:10:31,867 --> 00:10:37,133We try to understand that proces.10900:10:37,633 --> 00:10:48,933The final step, when a virus can be transmitted between humans, it becomes endemic,11000:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,333we try to understand how it has evolved to escape our immune system11100:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,833and the flu shot sometimes doesn't work.11200:10:57,267 --> 00:11:06,633We try to understand all facets of the evolution of viruses, from birds to humans,11300:11:06,933 --> 00:11:14,800so we can intervene and prevent outbreaks in poultry, prevent human pandemics11400:11:14,933 --> 00:11:17,033and to improve the flu shot.11500:11:17,367 --> 00:11:26,300Studying this evolution allows us to develop completely new intervention strategies.11600:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,867Influenza viruses can cause a lot of trouble...11700:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,367Yes, influenza has two forms of activity in humans, epedemics and pandemics.11800:11:37,667 --> 00:11:45,900Pandemics, woldwide outbreaks of a virus new to humans, can be very severe.11900:11:46,333 --> 00:11:53,633In 1918 a pandemic caused 15 million deaths, the last pandemic in 2009 was less severe.12000:11:54,033 --> 00:11:58,033In the future we want te prevent those pandemics.12100:11:58,133 --> 00:12:07,233For the last two centuries they happend every 20 to 30 years.12200:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,400And we are trying to prevent these pandemics from happening,12300:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,833we don't know if the next one will be mild,12400:12:14,067 --> 00:12:21,067or severe like the one in 1918 when millions of people died.12500:12:21,333 --> 00:12:27,433We know pandemic viruses jump from animals to humans.12600:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,767In humans they develop the capacity to spread through the respiratory system,12700:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,567by coughing, sneezing and breathing.12800:12:37,933 --> 00:12:43,900That is what distinguishes a pandemic virus from all other viruses.12900:12:44,100 --> 00:12:52,467My research group tries to understand is how a virus becomes contagious through the respiratory system.13000:12:52,667 --> 00:13:03,600On the one hand it's purely for fundamental knowledge, we don't know what makes a virus contagious.13100:13:03,933 --> 00:13:11,367On the other hand, if we know how it works, we will be able to do something about it.13200:13:11,633 --> 00:13:19,300We can develop new intervention strategies to stop a pandemic and save many lives.13300:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,133That is the goal of my research.13400:13:22,900 --> 00:13:30,467The research caused you quite some trouble in 2011, can you tell me what happened?13500:13:30,733 --> 00:13:42,800In 2007 we started to research the contagiousness of animal viruses in humans.13600:13:43,033 --> 00:13:52,567In 1997 we saw bird flu viruses that could infect and kill humans for the first time13700:13:52,733 --> 00:13:52,633very virulent forms of avian influenza.13800:13:55,333 --> 00:14:04,867Sinds 1997 everyone has been wondering if such a virus will cause the next pandemic,13900:14:05,167 --> 00:14:09,567one that might be like the spanish flu pandemic.14000:14:10,533 --> 00:14:19,433So we need to find out if the H5N1 virus really can be transmitted between mammals through the respiratory system.14100:14:19,933 --> 00:14:28,400We can't research this in humans, so we do animal testing, we use ferrets.14200:14:29,333 --> 00:14:41,900We mutated a H5N1 virus, using all our knowledge on pandemics14300:14:42,167 --> 00:14:55,633then we put the virus in the resperatory system of a ferret and let it adapt.14400:14:56,100 --> 00:15:06,833That way you can test if the virus can be transmitted to other ferrets by sneezing, coughing or breathing.14500:15:07,533 --> 00:15:20,133In 2011 we proved the Asian H5N1 virus can in fact become airborne.14600:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,267That was new, we were the first to discover it.14700:15:23,567 --> 00:15:36,167So we need to be cautious around the H5N1 virus, warn the world health organisation and the involved countries in Asia.14800:15:36,533 --> 00:15:42,167But we also gained fundamental knowledge on how a virus becomes airborne.14900:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,533This information can be used in surveillance studies15000:15:46,667 --> 00:15:55,333to see if such viruses are already emerging in the field, in that case we can start culling.15100:15:55,867 --> 00:16:03,633Above all this is the fundamental knowledge we had been waiting for in the field of virology.15200:16:03,767 --> 00:16:10,333We don't understand how a virus becomes contagious, yet here, we have two viruses,15300:16:10,400 --> 00:16:18,467an original H5N1 virus and one that is airborne. Now we can find out how a virus becomes airborne.15400:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,667That is precious scientific knowledge.15500:16:22,067 --> 00:16:32,700Unfortunately the American gouvernment was afraid terrorists would use this knowledge15600:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,633to make other viruses airborne, use it as a bio-weapon.15700:16:38,433 --> 00:16:47,767Due to the fear of the American gouvernment the publication of our research was initially forbidden.15800:16:48,200 --> 00:16:57,100Of course we took action, the information could possibly be abused15900:16:57,133 --> 00:17:04,867but more importantly it could definitely aid science and public health.16000:17:05,233 --> 00:17:15,767By culling and preventing pandemics we can save more lives than by hiding the results.16100:17:16,067 --> 00:17:21,533After months of discussion on whether this kind of information should be published16200:17:21,633 --> 00:17:29,700the American gouvernment, the World Health Organisation and the Dutch gouvernment decided it should be.16300:17:30,867 --> 00:17:33,533It advances science and public health.16400:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,067But you were threatened, people blamed you for doing this.16500:17:41,233 --> 00:17:53,933In october 2011 the American gouvernment told us the research could not be published.16600:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,300And we were not allowed to communicate about it.16700:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,833The Dutch gouvernment took their advice,16800:17:59,933 --> 00:18:07,567as a result the popular press got the idea that we did something terrible,16900:18:07,733 --> 00:18:16,867they reported that Fouchier's lab created a bio-weapon that could destroy the world.17000:18:17,233 --> 00:18:24,200The New York times wrote an absurd editorial calling it 'the doomsday virus'.17100:18:24,667 --> 00:18:28,767They did this because they didn't know the facts.17200:18:29,167 --> 00:18:40,500Withholding the manuscripts, not sharing our actual findings, caused commotion.17300:18:40,867 --> 00:18:49,300Simply because of the lack of knowledge. We were not allowed to explain the situation.17400:18:49,367 --> 00:18:59,600All this lead to a smear campaign against my research group and against me personally.17500:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,567You were really threatend personally, right?17600:19:01,833 --> 00:19:05,000Yes, very quickly there were threats on the internet17700:19:05,100 --> 00:19:11,267about what kind of car I drive, push him off the road, where my children go to school.17800:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,800It went that far?17900:19:13,067 --> 00:19:22,567Yes, unfortunately. I had police officers at my office, driving through my street. A shame.18000:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,000Do you ever look back?18100:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,333These things really affect you as a scientist.18200:19:29,667 --> 00:19:36,600Usually we are completely transparent in everything we do.18300:19:36,733 --> 00:19:40,300We work with students and foreign guests, we freely communicate18400:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,567and enjoy academic freedom, freedom of the press, we are payed with tax money.18500:19:47,667 --> 00:19:51,300So we prefer to be open to the whole world.18600:19:51,400 --> 00:20:04,200Now, however, it seemed like I used tax money for bio-weapons, against public health,18700:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,567instead of for public health, like I thought I was doing.18800:20:08,067 --> 00:20:16,900That switch in the notion of what kind of work we do, really affects you.18900:20:17,267 --> 00:20:19,033It turned into Dr. Strangelove.19000:20:19,333 --> 00:20:30,233Dr. Strangelove was mentioned, those sketches were on internet, I was depicted that way.19100:20:30,733 --> 00:20:31,567It was taken very far...19200:20:31,900 --> 00:20:41,133Yes, unfortunately at that moment due to a lacking exchange of information.19300:20:41,167 --> 00:20:47,533It shows how important freedom of expression is for the press and science.19400:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,367This freedom is extremely important.19500:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,767We can only defend ourselves by explaining what we did,19600:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,533why we did it and how did this safely.19700:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,667Do you ever feel like you have to watch your back, fear for your safety?19800:21:03,100 --> 00:21:10,933Even when we were threatend on the internet I never really felt unsafe.19900:21:10,967 --> 00:21:19,700I always viewed them as quite harmless idiots20000:21:19,933 --> 00:21:26,700though the police did feel they had to warn me, so it was someting.20100:21:26,900 --> 00:21:36,300I wasn't too worried about myself, I was more careful about my wife and kids.20200:21:36,667 --> 00:21:41,500I think I was a bit more free than my children at that moment.20300:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,433It shows how great the fear of viruses is.20400:21:46,667 --> 00:21:55,900Viruses have a bad reputation, they make you ill, you can't see them20500:21:56,367 --> 00:21:58,300so they are scary.20600:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,333But people don't realize viruses are everywhere.20700:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,833If you go swimming in the ocean, you're swimming in a pool of viruses.20800:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,967If you go swimming in a lake, it's also filled with viruses.20900:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,033But nothing happens.21000:22:09,433 --> 00:22:18,133Most viruses are harmeless, at utmost only infective in one host.21100:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,900A virus in a chickens is usually harmeless to humans.21200:22:22,033 --> 00:22:29,300But there are many movies where people turn into zombies because of a virus21300:22:29,333 --> 00:22:38,833or a virus kills 99% of the population, exept for one hero, who finds a vacciniation.21400:22:39,233 --> 00:22:51,100That is what people know, but it has nothing to do with reality, with real viruses.21500:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,700But you are occupied with beating viruses, disarming them?21600:23:00,433 --> 00:23:10,100Laboratories like mine do two things, we try to beat viral infections21700:23:10,233 --> 00:23:14,267using medication and vaccinations.21800:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,633We also research viruses for practical use.21900:23:21,900 --> 00:23:28,933For example to cure people or to advance our knowledge in biology.22000:23:29,067 --> 00:23:36,700And that's relevant, you are able to predict the evolution of a virus.22100:23:37,133 --> 00:23:42,733All the research on the evolution of influenza viruses22200:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,700from wild birds to human epidemics22300:23:46,267 --> 00:23:49,033are aimed at predicting that evolution.22400:23:49,467 --> 00:23:53,933Sometimes people find that funny, you can't predict evolution22500:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,700and indeed it is nearly impossible22600:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,233if, for example, you want to predict what people will look like in ten thousand years.22700:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,367But for viruses it is much easier.22800:24:03,833 --> 00:24:08,100Viruses have a very small amount of genetic material22900:24:08,467 --> 00:24:14,200an influenza virus' gentic material has fifteen thousand buiding blocks23000:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,567those fiteen thousand you can still count and read.23100:24:16,967 --> 00:24:22,833Furthermore we know what drives the evolution of these viruses.23200:24:23,167 --> 00:24:27,767Once a virus jumps from animal to animal, or to humans23300:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,233we know what has to change in the virus to adapt to it's new host.23400:24:34,667 --> 00:24:43,167The most important driving force for a virus in a human, is our immune system.23500:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,267The virus needs to escape our immune system.23600:24:46,333 --> 00:24:54,967The system of a virus in it's host is so simple, we can perfectly understand it.23700:24:55,367 --> 00:25:01,567If we understand this and how it relates to the genetic material23800:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,833we can easily predict the evolution.23900:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,300Once we can predict the evolution, we can be ahead of it.24000:25:08,433 --> 00:25:11,000We can make better vaccines and beter medication,24100:25:11,367 --> 00:25:15,333better preventive measures, that is the goal of my research.24200:25:15,667 --> 00:25:19,567You say it is simple, it can't really be?24300:25:20,033 --> 00:25:27,533It is much simpler than the evolution of a plant, human or animal.24400:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,533A flu virus had a small number of genetic building blocks.24500:25:30,867 --> 00:25:36,800So little I can count them, read them and understand what they are saying.24600:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,367And the driving forces of their evolution are really simple.24700:25:39,767 --> 00:25:44,833Because we only have to watch a limited number of factors24800:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,433we can start to understand the evolution and eventually predict it.24900:25:49,767 --> 00:25:53,933But it's not something that happens over a period of one or two years.25000:25:54,233 --> 00:25:58,267I have been occupied with influenza viruses for 15 years25100:25:58,633 --> 00:26:04,333and now I have started to test the first predictions in clnical studies.25200:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,667The predictions are on how the virus evolves in humans25300:26:08,967 --> 00:26:15,367and escapes our immune system, so we continually have to updat the flu shot.25400:26:15,733 --> 00:26:22,100We predict what a virus will look like in two years25500:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,267we already create a vaccine, to test if it might work better that the one we have.25600:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,300We predict the virus and intervene to see if we can prevent it.25700:26:37,967 --> 00:26:42,000You even developed computer programs to calculate these things.25800:26:42,333 --> 00:26:52,433In 1998 we started to develop programs to map the genetic material25900:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,933and the biological attributes of a virus.26000:26:56,633 --> 00:27:05,800So we can see how the genes and biological attiributes evolve over time.26100:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200And now we can recognize very distinct paterns.26200:27:09,300 --> 00:27:16,900These paterns are so clear we can predict what will happen next.26300:27:17,233 --> 00:27:20,100If you see evolution along a straight line26400:27:20,233 --> 00:27:24,667it's not very hard to predict where the virus will be in two years.26500:27:24,833 --> 00:27:27,900It'll be at a surtain point along that straight line.26600:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,867That is what we find in the antigenic drift of a virus,26700:27:33,167 --> 00:27:35,867the way they escape our immunse system.26800:27:36,133 --> 00:27:41,667We think this antigenic drift is so predictable26900:27:41,967 --> 00:27:45,367we can develop a flu shot now, that we'll use in two years.27000:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,833What does that promise for the future?27100:27:50,433 --> 00:27:59,167Virus research has always been the base for lots of other research27200:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,600because viruses are simple.27300:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,667So viruses are the starting point for research27400:28:03,733 --> 00:28:08,200and afterwards you can translate the results to other organisms.27500:28:08,533 --> 00:28:12,033Bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.27600:28:12,367 --> 00:28:18,733Eventually if we really can predict the evolution of a virus27700:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,033I don't see why we wouldn't be able27800:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,367to predict the evolution of a plant or an animal in a hundred years.27900:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,000That is a trend we've see in the past28000:28:30,233 --> 00:28:33,833first discoveries are done on bacteria and viruses28100:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,900because they are small and easy to understand.28200:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,967But in higher organisms the processes are exaclty the same.28300:28:43,367 --> 00:28:49,867So if we show we can predict something simple like the evolution of a virus28400:28:49,967 --> 00:28:55,033we can undoubtly eventually do the same for properties of higher organisms.28500:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,433What would that mean?28600:28:56,767 --> 00:29:06,833It could mean we'll be able to predict new crops, new species.28700:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,833How they'll develop as a result of changes in our ecosystem.28800:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,800Form Darwin's theory of evolution we know28900:29:19,933 --> 00:29:23,500the environment determines how an organism evolves.29000:29:23,700 --> 00:29:34,600By shaping the environment you can shape the organisms living in it.29100:29:34,767 --> 00:29:42,600This is thinking outside the box, many people believe you can't predict evolution.29200:29:42,767 --> 00:29:48,300But I think we'll show you can, beginning with simple processes,29300:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,267but eventually you can use the same approach on higher organisms29400:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,400and maybe adapt the environment to stear evolution.29500:29:58,567 --> 00:30:03,033Perhaps we want to know what humans will look like in ten thousand years.29600:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,567What you are saying is, with the knowledge of viruses29700:30:07,567 --> 00:30:11,633we don't just conquer the viruses, but genetic endowment.29800:30:12,433 --> 00:30:16,733Because of these viruses we'll really gain a better understanding of evolution.29900:30:17,133 --> 00:30:28,567Evolution theory is complex, but by using a simple virus you can understand it.30000:30:28,733 --> 00:30:35,033And the evolution of a virus is fundamentally not different from a plant, human or animal.30100:30:35,400 --> 00:30:43,867So by really understaning viruses, I think we'll indeed be able to translate it30200:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,767to higher organisms and guide and predict evolution.30300:30:48,967 --> 00:30:54,967That's one thing, another is you can use viruses as a tool.30400:30:55,567 --> 00:31:02,233Viruses are simple, they don't have many genetic building blocks30500:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,733especially the viruses I work on, RNA viruses.30600:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,433We completely understand their building blocks.30700:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,300We know which ones we can remove, how to change them30800:31:13,533 --> 00:31:17,233so we change the properties of a virus.30900:31:17,333 --> 00:31:26,533That's why a virus that would kill us 30 years ago, AIDS/HIV,31000:31:26,667 --> 00:31:34,967can now be used to cure children with an autoimmune disease.31100:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,233We understand how the HIV virus multiplies,31200:31:42,633 --> 00:31:49,867we remove pieces from the genetic material, so it is no longer pathogenic.31300:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,433It can't autonomously multiply anymore31400:31:52,733 --> 00:31:57,533and the pieces we removed can be replaced by a gene of our choosing.31500:31:57,700 --> 00:32:04,233We can choose a gene that had a defect within the patient population.31600:32:04,333 --> 00:32:12,267That way HIV based gene therapies are developed.31700:32:12,433 --> 00:32:16,000The HIV that used to make you ill is changed31800:32:16,167 --> 00:32:22,033using the copy of a correct gene that is faulty within the patient population,31900:32:22,467 --> 00:32:29,967next you infect the children with the HIV virus to heal them.32000:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,86740 years ago we never would've predicted32100:32:33,967 --> 00:32:37,667we would understand a deadly virus like AIDS  so well32200:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,800that we'd be able to change it a bit and use it to cure children.32300:32:45,333 --> 00:32:50,633In stead of just fighting viruses you can also use them now?32400:32:51,267 --> 00:33:00,333We use viruses to repair fautly genes in patients.32500:33:00,800 --> 00:33:10,500A fault gene, an immune defect, can cause patients to die very young.32600:33:10,633 --> 00:33:19,467And now we tweeked HIV, a virus that caused AIDS and death 30 years ago,32700:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,500in such a way it can now cure these young children.32800:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,867We completely understand the AIDS virus, know all the genetic building blocks.32900:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,733We can remove the blocks that would normally make people ill33000:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,900and we can replace them by a gene of our choosing.33100:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,633In this case a the correct gene which the children are missing.33200:33:42,067 --> 00:33:55,400We use the virus as a method to provide the genetic material that was missing.33300:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,167The virus enters their cells33400:33:59,233 --> 00:34:05,233and they grow into healty cells with the correct copy of the gene.33500:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,567So viruses that were deadly 30 years ago are now used to cure children.33600:34:12,067 --> 00:34:16,267What does that mean for the future?33700:34:16,733 --> 00:34:26,267We say our research is important for fundamental science33800:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,300but of course there practical applications.33900:34:30,533 --> 00:34:35,700If I understand how an influenza virus is transmitted through the respiratory system34000:34:35,867 --> 00:34:39,200how it is stable in an aerosol34100:34:39,433 --> 00:34:43,700and which cells in the respitory system it can infect34200:34:44,067 --> 00:34:47,600you can immagine I'll be able to replicate the virus34300:34:47,667 --> 00:34:56,133add proteines and make a nano particle34400:34:56,233 --> 00:34:59,300that has the same properties as the influenza virus34500:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,333but is is filled with medication.34600:35:02,333 --> 00:35:09,033I'd be able to give mediation to all the cells in my repiratory system through a spray.34700:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,833With particles that look like the influenza virus,34800:35:11,833 --> 00:35:16,067they are airborne and stable34900:35:16,133 --> 00:35:19,067and target the cells of the epithelium.35000:35:19,067 --> 00:35:23,367It might be a way to treat patients with cystic fibrosis.35100:35:23,933 --> 00:35:29,600It's all wishful thinking, but that's how science works.35200:35:29,667 --> 00:35:35,867We do basic research to understand fundamental problems35300:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,533and we don't know which one have practical implications yet.35400:35:42,667 --> 00:35:47,633We can think about it, but we won't know for sure.35500:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,900It's special, on the one hand you combat them, on the other hand you use them.35600:35:52,033 --> 00:36:03,733Whether you combat or use a virus, the research method is the same.35700:36:03,933 --> 00:36:06,500You need to know exactly how a virus works.35800:36:06,633 --> 00:36:12,933How it enters a cell, why it destroys the cell and how a virus spreads.35900:36:13,067 --> 00:36:17,767If I know how a virus spreads, I might be able to stop it.36000:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,267If I know how it destroys a cell, I might be able to stop it with medication.36100:36:22,467 --> 00:36:25,400If I know how our immune system reacts to a virus,36200:36:25,467 --> 00:36:28,433I can prepare it with a vaccine.36300:36:28,800 --> 00:36:40,033Research for combatting viruses and using viruses is identical.36400:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,867You need to understand every detail of how a virus works.36500:36:43,967 --> 00:36:53,867Are you informed of potential epedemics and pandemics?36600:36:54,533 --> 00:37:04,600The past 15 years we developed tools to map epedemics.36700:37:04,767 --> 00:37:09,467The evolution of the genetic and biological properties of a virus36800:37:09,633 --> 00:37:18,767can be quantitatively tracked by a mathematical tool.36900:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,400These tools are a mathematical methods using lab data.37000:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,600The world health organisation now uses it to map all viruses.37100:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,867So we have real time acces to data on how all viruses in the world evolve over time.37200:37:40,967 --> 00:37:47,800That is an great source of information, not just for improving and updating the flu shot37300:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,633but also for research on the evolution of viruses.37400:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,500If everyone in the world isolates and analyses ten thousand viruses every year37500:37:59,633 --> 00:38:06,233and sends us data for analysing, we get amazing data sets.37600:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,400And in case of a code red, what happens?37700:38:10,667 --> 00:38:19,833A code red is when new viruses are transmissable from animals to humans.37800:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,767Laboratories like ours, with a broad selection of specialisms,37900:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,400are asked to assist research.38000:38:31,533 --> 00:38:39,567We did this in 2003 during the SARS outbreak, in 1997 with H5N1,38100:38:39,667 --> 00:38:46,233in 2012 with the outbreak of MERS, at the moment with ZIKA.38200:38:46,433 --> 00:38:51,300We are asked to help with research.38300:38:51,467 --> 00:38:57,333It starts with very basic questions. Why is this virus transmitted to humans?38400:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,233Why do we becom ill? Why do we die?38500:39:00,367 --> 00:39:04,400Is there something we can do, can we develop a vaccine or medication?38600:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,467These are very practical questions our department had been able to answer.38700:39:10,500 --> 00:39:15,500So they call us when there is an outbreak, it's a great honour38800:39:15,567 --> 00:39:21,600and we like being able to contribute to public healthcare.38900:39:21,967 --> 00:39:26,600But this also provides us with material for further research.39000:39:26,667 --> 00:39:29,500We can answer those basic questions quite quickly39100:39:29,600 --> 00:39:37,267but finding out how a virus really works takes many years of research.39200:39:37,367 --> 00:39:42,367And we can do that research because we were involved from the beginning.39300:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,533Can you immagine there being a universal vaccination for the flu?39400:39:51,700 --> 00:40:01,867The holy grail within the world of viruses is a universal flu shot.39500:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,067At the moment we create a flu shot for the current influenza virus.39600:40:08,233 --> 00:40:11,333We take a look at the epidemics every year39700:40:11,400 --> 00:40:16,300to see which viruses are ciruclating, and we make a vaccine.39800:40:16,900 --> 00:40:24,533But there is a huge diversity in influenza viruses, in all kinds of animals.39900:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,300A vaccine that protects against all these forms would be ideal.40000:40:30,467 --> 00:40:34,867Our lab researches this, together with many others,40100:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,833including the farmaceutical industry.40200:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,133That's why it's the holy grail.40300:40:39,267 --> 00:40:43,600If you can develop a vaccine against all influenza viruses40400:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,833you are, what we would call, in business.40500:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,233I do think such a vaccine will be developed.40600:40:50,333 --> 00:40:56,700It might take 10 or 15 years of research, but I am convinced we'll get there.40700:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,867We'll completely conquer viruses?40800:41:00,433 --> 00:41:03,400We'll definitely conquer influenza viruses.40900:41:03,467 --> 00:41:08,167I expect I'll have to look for a different job in 15 years41000:41:08,267 --> 00:41:15,800because the flu, just like AIDS, won't be deadly anymore.41100:41:17,167 --> 00:41:29,133You're lab was feared... Are there still things you have to keep secret?41200:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,167My lab does not have any secrets.41300:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,333My research is funded by tax money, I work with students a lot.41400:41:38,867 --> 00:41:41,267Master students and PhD students,41500:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,233post docs from all over the world.41600:41:44,367 --> 00:41:49,367In a completely transparent way, we don't try to keep anything to ourselves.41700:41:49,467 --> 00:41:53,967There is research done in so called classified labs41800:41:54,133 --> 00:41:59,167belonging to the American, Chinese or Russian army.41900:41:59,333 --> 00:42:04,333They research the threat of bio-warfare.42000:42:04,533 --> 00:42:11,800But it's not what we do, we do research to aid public health and animal welfare.42100:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,367Let that be clear. We saw the ducks...42200:42:19,567 --> 00:42:25,233Can you tell me why you have them?42300:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,500Wild birds are the natural reservoir for influenza viruses.42400:42:30,700 --> 00:42:36,167All viruses we know in humans come from animals.42500:42:36,367 --> 00:42:41,600Wild animals are natural reservoirs for those viruses.42600:42:41,733 --> 00:42:48,233Bats are a notorious reservoir for cronaviruses like SARS and MERS.42700:42:48,433 --> 00:42:52,633And wild birds are the reservoir for all influenza viruses.42800:42:52,667 --> 00:42:55,233All influenza viruses we know, avian influenza in poultry42900:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,767swine influenza, the flu in humans... All come from wild birds.43000:42:59,933 --> 00:43:05,567To understand and handle the virus in pigs, humans and poultry43100:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,533you need to understand what happens in that reservoir.43200:43:08,667 --> 00:43:13,933In the natural reservoir like wild ducks, sea gulls.43300:43:14,033 --> 00:43:20,367You need to understand how the virus evolves in those hosts, in wild birds.43400:43:20,467 --> 00:43:26,233Know the genetic and biological diversity.43500:43:26,367 --> 00:43:33,633Some viruses can be transmitted to poultry or pigs, but others can't.43600:43:34,133 --> 00:43:39,100You have to start you research with those wild birds.43700:43:39,233 --> 00:43:43,367There's just one way to do that, you have to catch a lot of wild birds.43800:43:43,600 --> 00:43:49,133An infected bird only sheds the virus for 5 days43900:43:49,267 --> 00:43:54,533so you have to catch a great number of birds to map all viruses.44000:43:55,033 --> 00:43:59,400We've been doing this for 15 years, in the Netherlands and other countries.44100:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,433Slowly we are starting to understand44200:44:01,567 --> 00:44:08,267how these viruses drift around the world in wild birds44300:44:08,333 --> 00:44:12,767and how they end up in poultry, pigs and humans.44400:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,833So you take them and analyse them in here?44500:44:15,900 --> 00:44:26,600We've set up a network of ornithologists all over the world.44600:44:26,900 --> 00:44:40,100They send samples form the cloaka or throat of birds to my lab.44700:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,000And we test it for influenza viruses.44800:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,967In that case we isolate it in our lab.44900:44:48,533 --> 00:44:54,033After we've cultivated it, we can genetically characterize it,45000:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,100we can map all the genetic material.45100:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,067And we can determine the biological properties,45200:45:03,267 --> 00:45:09,300we can find out if the virus can infect the cells of mammals,45300:45:09,467 --> 00:45:15,067if it can escape our immune system, things like that.45400:45:15,367 --> 00:45:19,600So these viruses are characterized elaborately.45500:45:20,500 --> 00:45:29,000How difficult is it to change a virus?45600:45:29,633 --> 00:45:41,167For some virus families it is very easy, for others very difficult.45700:45:41,367 --> 00:45:45,600There are small viruses, large viruses, RNA viruses, DNA viruses...45800:45:45,700 --> 00:45:52,300I work on respiratory viruses with an RNA genome, they aren't too large,45900:45:52,433 --> 00:46:01,767and you need special expression systems to make them.46000:46:01,967 --> 00:46:06,067It isn't simple, but is has become a routine job.46100:46:06,233 --> 00:46:10,400Once you have a well trained team of molecular biologists46200:46:10,467 --> 00:46:14,267you can easily make a couple of new viruses every day.46300:46:14,367 --> 00:46:26,767But for a new team it would take 6 or 7 years to get the hang of it.46400:46:26,900 --> 00:46:31,233It demands a high degree of specilization.46500:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,667It's doable for your team?46600:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,467Yes, we make viruses on a daily basis.46700:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,467We make viruses with up to 3 point mutations in the genes.46800:46:41,533 --> 00:46:47,067Sometimes we add genes to a virus, fluorescent proteines for example46900:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,300so you get a fluorescent virus47000:46:49,400 --> 00:46:57,967and you can easily see how it infects a test animal.47100:46:58,267 --> 00:47:07,000Sometimes we remove a gene to see how we can disable it47200:47:07,033 --> 00:47:11,433and possibly turn it into a vaccine.47300:47:11,667 --> 00:47:19,700It's facinating, they're so tiny you can hardly see them with a regular microscope47400:47:19,767 --> 00:47:26,067however you can change them, change the genetic material.47500:47:26,467 --> 00:47:31,933You can clone a viruses' genetic material,47600:47:32,133 --> 00:47:39,167grow it in bacteria, so you get tons of it.47700:47:39,267 --> 00:47:41,433Then you can cut and paste.47800:47:41,567 --> 00:47:49,033Simply put, you can cut and paste pieces of DNA and RNA.47900:47:49,133 --> 00:47:52,300You can make any combination you like.48000:47:52,433 --> 00:47:57,567However most combinations won't work.48100:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,700But if you understand a virus48200:47:59,800 --> 00:48:06,900you'll know how to cut and past in order to change the virus.48300:48:07,267 --> 00:48:13,100After you've mutated the genetic material48400:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,300you can extract the DNA from the bacteria48500:48:16,433 --> 00:48:21,267and transfer it to a mammal cell in a culture dish.48600:48:21,467 --> 00:48:27,733If you do it using the right DNA you can create a virus.48700:48:27,933 --> 00:48:32,433It sounds simple, and it is if you know what you're doing,48800:48:32,700 --> 00:48:37,067but a nonprofessional won't be able to do it.48900:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,200Viruses are like machines, geometrical, with a special structure.49000:48:46,900 --> 00:48:52,400Viruses are in fact tiny nano machines49100:48:52,633 --> 00:48:59,267pieces of genetic material, packed in proteines, to protect it.49200:48:59,433 --> 00:49:09,900Some proteines, polymerases, make sure the genetic material will multiply in a cell.49300:49:10,033 --> 00:49:16,633The genetic material is protected from outside air in a wax ball49400:49:16,800 --> 00:49:25,767which has thornes to help it attacht to a cell.49500:49:26,033 --> 00:49:30,467It's a nano machine, a wax ball, with genetic material49600:49:30,600 --> 00:49:38,467and proteines that help it to infect a cell, multiply and infect the next host.49700:49:38,600 --> 00:49:44,767We can use those characteristics for our benefit.49800:49:44,867 --> 00:49:51,100You can use a virus to put genetic material into a cell.49900:49:51,333 --> 00:49:57,533Depending on the kind of virus, a respiratory virus,50000:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,767a liver virus, or a virus carried in the blood,50100:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,833based on those characteristics you can build a new nano machine50200:50:08,967 --> 00:50:17,167that targets genetic material in the cells of the lungs, blood or the liver.50300:50:17,367 --> 00:50:20,000That's what we now use viruses for.50400:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,200That is really happening?50500:50:21,267 --> 00:50:28,900Yes, we can put genes in the blood of people with an immune disease50600:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,767so their genes can be repaired.50700:50:32,200 --> 00:50:42,067We can make viruses so they destroy tumor cells instead of normal cells.50800:50:42,333 --> 00:50:46,533We can use viruses to treat cancer.50900:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,233Those are all applications of viruses that are already being used.51000:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,367The first drugs to repair gene defects and cure cancer are on the market.51100:50:57,633 --> 00:50:58,900Where will that take us?51200:50:59,267 --> 00:51:05,500I think eventually virology will really contribute to public health.51300:51:05,633 --> 00:51:10,600We'll solve many gene defects and forms of cancers,51400:51:10,733 --> 00:51:19,467by using genetically modifying viruses to cure people and animals.51500:51:19,733 --> 00:51:29,267Is that a promise? Or is it an uncertain probability?51600:51:29,633 --> 00:51:35,467We can already cure a number of illnesses using viruses.51700:51:35,667 --> 00:51:45,000We can repair a gene defect using the AIDS virus.51800:51:45,200 --> 00:51:55,733We can cure skin cancer using a genetically modified herpes virus.51900:51:55,933 --> 00:52:07,900We're working on other viruses that can infect tumors cells52000:52:07,933 --> 00:52:11,300and start a massive immune reaction52100:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,667so the immune system will clean up the tumor.52200:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,300It's called oncolytic immunotherapy52300:52:18,367 --> 00:52:22,133using a virus that kills tumor cells52400:52:22,300 --> 00:52:30,233and also starts a immune reaction against them.52500:52:30,433 --> 00:52:32,567So your own body will clean up the tumor.52600:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,033It works really well in mice,52700:52:35,333 --> 00:52:42,500in our lab we've done it on mice with pancreatic cancer,52800:52:42,633 --> 00:52:48,433and using a modified virus it completely dissapeared.52900:52:48,667 --> 00:52:54,133We'll need to do more research before we can do it for humans.53000:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,900But we're working on it very hard.53100:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,433And I am convinced, in 10 years, we'll be able to cure many forms of cancer53200:53:03,567 --> 00:53:08,767using immunotherapy or viral immunotherapy.53300:53:08,867 --> 00:53:12,533Viruses as a universal medicine.53400:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,500Viruses as an engineered nano particle53500:53:18,533 --> 00:53:21,833which you specifically target53600:53:21,900 --> 00:53:29,833so you use the viruses' beautiful properties to benefit it's host.
