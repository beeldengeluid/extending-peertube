1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,37
Speaker 1: So what makes it so unique in your eyes, what you are doing with your team?

2
00:00:06,37 --> 00:00:21,03
Speaker 2: The idea is to be open, I think open for looking for interesting solutions in nature and the approach,

3
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:28,56
probably quite unique still from my group, but I think it becoming more and more popular, is,

4
00:00:28,56 --> 00:00:31,76
we have two directions of how we look at nature.

5
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:38,46
One is, let's say there's an interesting creature doing something amazing,

6
00:00:38,46 --> 00:00:46,06
and we are trying to learn the- what is happening and maybe apply it.

7
00:00:46,62 --> 00:00:50,04
That's one approach, and apply it maybe to different things.

8
00:00:50,05 --> 00:01:00,63
But even more interesting, it's just emerging now, is that instead of looking for one creature that tells us something,

9
00:01:00,9 --> 00:01:05,1
what if we take lessons from completely different organisms?

10
00:01:05,71 --> 00:01:11,16
They have nothing in common, they have different environments, but one can teach something,

11
00:01:11,16 --> 00:01:14,11
but it's not enough for certain purpose.

12
00:01:14,34 --> 00:01:18,08
Together with yet another organism, you can learn something else,

13
00:01:18,46 --> 00:01:27,37
and combining lessons from completely different organisms that evolve their things for their specific needs,

14
00:01:27,37 --> 00:01:29,43
then to solve a certain problem.

15
00:01:29,44 --> 00:01:38,02
So that's a really interesting approach, is really take small lessons from different, from plants,

16
00:01:38,27 --> 00:01:47,35
from brittle stars because I have research where I combine lessons from this creature with this,

17
00:01:47,69 --> 00:01:53,39
so they have nothing in common. That one taught us something, this one taught us something.

18
00:01:53,76 --> 00:02:01,96
Combining them together, we produce a new technology that would never appear if we wouldn't combine these two lessons.

19
00:02:01,96 --> 00:02:06,1
So the idea of combining different creatures-

20
00:02:06,1 --> 00:02:16,96
Speaker 1: What will [inaudible 00:02:07] combined from the two?	So can you explain what did you learn of these two?

21
00:02:16,96 --> 00:02:25,72
Speaker 2: So you probably know who are starfish and sea urchins.

22
00:02:26,28 --> 00:02:34,84
So this is the closest relative of both, so it's also you see his five folds in his ray of the body,

23
00:02:34,99 --> 00:02:42,25
just like a starfish, but it's called brittle star. Its arms are called brittles, it's very fast.

24
00:02:42,68 --> 00:02:52,9
You see it's black, and it's already dead of course, but during the day, it's black and during the night, it is white.

25
00:02:52,9 --> 00:03:04,02
And the way it changes color is by introducing inside the, its skeleton,

26
00:03:04,02 --> 00:03:10,75
black pigment that covers the lens just like some glasses that change color when there's too much light.

27
00:03:11,17 --> 00:03:19,38
This is what this organism does, and makes light reception dynamic depending how much light outside,

28
00:03:19,39 --> 00:03:29,82
so that's the lesson from here. This one has structural color, so this blue is structural color.

29
00:03:30,02 --> 00:03:34,51
Structural color means that it's not chemical color.

30
00:03:34,83 --> 00:03:41,09
It's not coming from pigment, it's coming from arrangement of peaches.

31
00:03:41,09 --> 00:03:47,34
It's coming purely from distances between peaches in this structure.

32
00:03:47,56 --> 00:03:54,6
So depending how close they are, it would be the blue or green, so it has almost nothing to do with the material.

33
00:03:54,61 --> 00:04:03,49
I can get blue color in any material by just making it in their regular array. Now this color is not dynamic.

34
00:04:03,49 --> 00:04:14,28
It's not changing in any way, so we can combine the idea of how liquid here changes color of this organism,

35
00:04:14,28 --> 00:04:24,23
and introduce this liquid as an active element into structures that would make very similar to that butterfly.

36
00:04:25,61 --> 00:04:37,48
Result of that is that we put together new technology where the color can change as a function of infiltration of a

37
00:04:37,56 --> 00:04:43,1
liquid, but then we use this for very interesting applications.

38
00:04:43,1 --> 00:04:51,33
We're looking how that concept was liquid, suddenly changes color in different ways,

39
00:04:51,33 --> 00:04:54,88
and I will probably show you a couple of those things in the lab.

40
00:04:54,88 --> 00:05:08,88
We can use that as sensor, we can use it for encryption because, there's certain messages can be written there,

41
00:05:08,88 --> 00:05:12,65
and you will never see them. We actually have a butterfly with tattoo.

42
00:05:13,6 --> 00:05:25,61
The tattoo is coming out, only one you expose to a liquid and that gives us a way to have hidden messages.

43
00:05:25,61 --> 00:05:30,69
Logos that would appear only when you expose it to right liquid.

44
00:05:31,69 --> 00:05:38,48
So the oral idea of dynamic materials is in this particular case, by combining these strategies,

45
00:05:38,48 --> 00:05:46,34
but we have many more examples of one organism teaches something, and the other one teaches a little bit more,

46
00:05:46,34 --> 00:05:46,88
and together, it's interesting.

47
00:05:46,88 --> 00:05:49,01
Speaker 1: And you apply it to materials in a way?

48
00:05:49,01 --> 00:05:58,02
Speaker 2: Yes, so we're making now, and we're actually making, I actually have a lot of them,

49
00:05:58,23 --> 00:06:06,97
but most of them are in design school because I use them for teaching, but we'll see some of them in my lab,

50
00:06:06,97 --> 00:06:13,85
where you will see it looks exactly like this beautiful blue color, but it's actually material that we make,

51
00:06:13,85 --> 00:06:15,94
but compared to this.

52
00:06:17,09 --> 00:06:28,53
As simple as, imagine a shot glass that has beautiful color, and depending on what you drink,

53
00:06:28,91 --> 00:06:32,84
it will give you different messages that you don't know really existed.

54
00:06:32,84 --> 00:06:38,79
So simple way to make it beautiful, but in fact, we can use it.

55
00:06:39,26 --> 00:06:52,12
In particular, we're working with department of transportation to design it into a sensor for detection of oil quality,

56
00:06:52,13 --> 00:07:02,1
so in North Dakota, they're pulling out a lot of oil. There is no pipe line, and they're transporting it by rail.

57
00:07:02,1 --> 00:07:05,12
And within the last couple of years,

58
00:07:05,12 --> 00:07:12,94
there were a lot of explosions because oil was not properly labeled by what type of oil that is.

59
00:07:13,45 --> 00:07:23,08
So to have a very simple detector that has beautiful color and depending on the quality of oil,

60
00:07:23,49 --> 00:07:30,21
this oil would either infiltrate it or not, and therefore the color will change in certain ways.

61
00:07:30,21 --> 00:07:47,36
As a very simple, you don't need to use fancy equipment, it's almost pregnancy tests or pH paper..

62
00:07:39,07 --> 00:07:47,11
You put it in oil and you know what quality it is in which container you need to pack it so ..

63
00:07:47,36 --> 00:07:53,92
Speaker 1: So you learn from nature, from animals or plants, or organisms?

64
00:07:53,92 --> 00:07:54,31
Speaker 2: Yup.

65
00:07:54,31 --> 00:07:59,15
Speaker 1: You learn from their characteristics or from their, what their, if you go deeper into,

66
00:07:59,15 --> 00:08:00,54
what biologies normally do.

67
00:08:00,54 --> 00:08:10,8
Speaker 2: That's right, so I don't call it by a mimicry, because I'm not mimicking nature, it is by inspired science.

68
00:08:10,91 --> 00:08:18,38
So I use it as an inspiration, and things that I make are not necessarily even used the same way nature used it,

69
00:08:18,72 --> 00:08:21,48
often for completely different application.

70
00:08:21,48 --> 00:08:27,01
It's just certain design principles that nature has evolved,

71
00:08:27,01 --> 00:08:33,62
become very interesting approaches that one can use for smart materials design.

72
00:08:33,62 --> 00:08:44,09
So it is not mimicking nature, it is taking lessons inspired by nature, and think where we can use these beyond,

73
00:08:44,9 --> 00:08:47,47
well beyond what nature is doing.

74
00:08:48,07 --> 00:08:57,1
And also, we can't, at this moment, mimic the entire complexity of natural system, and probably I don't want to.

75
00:08:57,1 --> 00:09:06,77
So the butterfly and this sea urchins, they need to multiply, they need to do all kinds of things.

76
00:09:06,78 --> 00:09:13,66
If I'm making a device, let's say, to detect quality of oil, I don't need all of these features.

77
00:09:13,66 --> 00:09:16,38
So being able to extract from nature.

78
00:09:16,38 --> 00:09:23,3
So to take these principles, and simplify them sometimes,

79
00:09:23,3 --> 00:09:30,61
or reformulate them in such a way that it can be used somewhere else. This is what we actually do.

80
00:09:30,61 --> 00:09:41,12
Speaker 1: In a way, evolution already chose the best way of having organisms.

81
00:09:41,12 --> 00:09:51,65
Speaker 2: I may not agree with that, I'm not sure that evolution always makes the best choice.

82
00:09:51,65 --> 00:10:01,01
In a sense that there is always local pressures, local environmental conditions and often,

83
00:10:03,16 --> 00:10:12,59
nature has the materials stuck with certain choices that is very expensive to change.

84
00:10:13,06 --> 00:10:21,98
And then, within that range, so I would say that, my logical solutions are often sub-optimal. Not optimal.

85
00:10:21,98 --> 00:10:30,06
We have our ideas, why? In particular, published in a number of papers.

86
00:10:30,87 --> 00:10:40,14
So if we look, we got this paper that was actually describing how this organism changes color, but it's a skeleton,

87
00:10:40,14 --> 00:10:48,47
so nature often does something we do not do yet, which is designing one material for multiple purposes.

88
00:10:48,47 --> 00:10:58,01
So, often natural design might not be best for each of the purposes it has to serve,

89
00:10:58,01 --> 00:11:01,13
but it does it very well for multiple things.

90
00:11:01,14 --> 00:11:06,74
For example, if I design lenses, and these are lenses on top of a skeleton,

91
00:11:06,74 --> 00:11:12,33
maybe I'll design lenses in a different way, and better than these in a different material,

92
00:11:12,33 --> 00:11:15,59
but the same material is supposed to be a skeleton.

93
00:11:16,06 --> 00:11:21,47
So it's not just optically perfect, it has to be structurally perfect.

94
00:11:22,1 --> 00:11:29,33
So neither of them are probably perfect, but to think about one material that can do both things well enough,

95
00:11:30,08 --> 00:11:34,23
then evolution finds the best solution for that.

96
00:11:34,24 --> 00:11:41,36
And sometimes we'll look at this optimization, there are so many parameters you need to optimize for,

97
00:11:41,36 --> 00:11:49,24
maybe there are some that we don't even know about, and then what we can say, flaws of evolution.

98
00:11:49,39 --> 00:11:57,77
It's not perfect, it could be done better. Maybe not, because the material is supposed to do many other things.

99
00:11:57,78 --> 00:12:07,29
For example, multiply, dissolve at certain moment, and then our regular approaches of why not to make it out glass,

100
00:12:07,29 --> 00:12:14,36
why not to make it out of metal, will not be applicable, and therefore not used in nature.

101
00:12:14,36 --> 00:12:20,82
So multi-functionality is a very interesting approach.

102
00:12:20,82 --> 00:12:26,7
Speaker 1: So what you are doing is creating next nature in a way.

103
00:12:26,7 --> 00:12:29,87
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I would say that.

104
00:12:30,26 --> 00:12:36,85
I would just say that maybe there are creatures that already have these features,

105
00:12:36,86 --> 00:12:48,3
but what we are trying to do is combine unrelated lessons from different organisms together to solve an interesting

106
00:12:48,3 --> 00:12:49,41
societal problem,

107
00:12:49,41 --> 00:12:58,08
some interesting technical problem to create a new material that can do something that our current materials can't do.

108
00:12:59,34 --> 00:13:06,62
So it is not next nature, but I would say it's next generation of advanced materials.

109
00:13:07,29 --> 00:13:16,82
Materials that respond to environment, so why can't we have our buildings that either breathe,

110
00:13:16,82 --> 00:13:26,11
or shut the wettability depending whether it's the rain outside or not.

111
00:13:26,11 --> 00:13:39,22
Why can't we have our entire windows that would, in a smart way, which means in response to temperature outside,

112
00:13:39,52 --> 00:13:44,78
to light outside, change the performance to let the light through or not.

113
00:13:44,78 --> 00:13:58,61
There is so many things that if we consider general lessons from nature that we haven't yet, understood very well,

114
00:13:58,7 --> 00:14:06,21
which is responsiveness, which is adaptive nature and ability to reconfigure, adjust.

115
00:14:07,95 --> 00:14:16,45
If we would have materials of that kind, that would be a really interesting move for technology.

116
00:14:16,45 --> 00:14:20,68
Speaker 1: What's the thing where you are now the most proud of if you apply to material?

117
00:14:20,68 --> 00:14:25,46
Speaker 2: That's a tough question.

118
00:14:25,46 --> 00:14:31,04
I have a very big group, and in a way, each of these projects is my baby,

119
00:14:31,32 --> 00:14:37,34
so you don't ask which baby you don't like most out of your kids.

120
00:14:38,00 --> 00:14:46,39
Each of them, in some ways, satisfies different parts of what is important to me.

121
00:14:47,48 --> 00:14:54,53
If you would ask what is the most interesting science, it's one part of that.

122
00:14:54,72 --> 00:15:06,72
I don't even often, in this case, as question, is it going to be useful, is just to uncover interesting mechanisms

123
00:15:06,72 --> 00:15:10,81
and ideas and what nature does in interesting ways.

124
00:15:10,81 --> 00:15:14,79
And there are a couple of things where we are proud of in this direction.

125
00:15:16,24 --> 00:15:21,09
For example, to understand the structure of this plant.

126
00:15:21,5 --> 00:15:31,2
So to understand that the organism was able to create a fiber-optical network, and a beautiful skeleton of glass,

127
00:15:31,66 --> 00:15:43,5
and fully explain how this is structurally, and from materials point of view, is design and is architecture.

128
00:15:43,5 --> 00:15:52,91
That's, I'm proud of. I also like, in this direction, ability to grow pretty much any crystal I want.

129
00:15:52,91 --> 00:16:04,88
We may look at some of them in the microscope later on just to grow flowers that are just size of human hair

130
00:16:04,88 --> 00:16:09,38
or smaller that, but in any shape or form.

131
00:16:09,81 --> 00:16:16,51
So that to understand them, the lengths, I am so well that we can do it, so I am very proud of that part.

132
00:16:16,98 --> 00:16:28,45
Now the other side though, is that is we do not just science purpose, but coming not from science

133
00:16:28,45 --> 00:16:34,55
and then thinking where one can use it, but to do it the other way around, starting with a problem

134
00:16:34,55 --> 00:16:36,77
and think how one can solve it.

135
00:16:36,77 --> 00:16:48,51
So these are more technology or application oriented studies and there, and the ones that I'm most proud of, probably,

136
00:16:48,51 --> 00:17:00,52
are the two developments that have happened in my group in the last five, six years. And these are two technologies.

137
00:17:00,99 --> 00:17:14,32
One is based on inspiration coming from pitcher plant where we really developed completely new family of materials that

138
00:17:14,32 --> 00:17:17,99
can be designed in a very simple way at this moment.

139
00:17:17,99 --> 00:17:30,63
We can make it in metal, polymer and glass, and any material but the material that would repel, what you want to repel,

140
00:17:30,63 --> 00:17:33,14
it would repel ice, it would repel barnacles and mussels.

141
00:17:33,14 --> 00:17:43,51
It would repel blood, it would repel bacteria, and to create the family of [inaudible 00:17:41] materials.

142
00:17:43,51 --> 00:17:55,49
Very proud of this work, and I'm very proud of work of where we can use self-assembled materials and structural color,

143
00:17:55,49 --> 00:18:04,48
actually, as sensors, as a way to detect and reveal how materials are exposed to environment,

144
00:18:04,48 --> 00:18:10,9
so these are two that are related to applications there.

145
00:18:11,44 --> 00:18:17,87
The overall idea for that came from, we want to solve a problem, of let's say, fouling.

146
00:18:18,11 --> 00:18:23,00
What should we do, which organism should we look at to help us do it.

147
00:18:23,02 --> 00:18:33,59
So not from the organisms to application, but rather from application to organisms and natural system that can help.

148
00:18:33,59 --> 00:18:48,45
Speaker 1: And when you look at it, we can create- there is an endless future of possibilities in your science.

149
00:18:48,45 --> 00:18:54,2
It's like, a whole new world's opening by looking at biology in this way,

150
00:18:54,72 --> 00:19:00,23
and then thinking about characteristics that can be used in other materials.

151
00:19:00,23 --> 00:19:06,85
Speaker 2: I agree. The, I hope that there would be more and more studies of this kind.

152
00:19:06,85 --> 00:19:13,64
It's just a good example of that is our recent paper, actually published this year in nature,

153
00:19:14,73 --> 00:19:26,6
was on making the most efficient ethics changes, the most efficient water collection systems,

154
00:19:26,6 --> 00:19:33,51
and the way we designed it was combining lessons from three different natural systems,

155
00:19:34,12 --> 00:19:43,98
where we were looking on how to optimize three parameters, all of them orthogonal to each other, very different,

156
00:19:44,91 --> 00:19:49,45
and combining these three organisms gave us the best solution.

157
00:19:49,46 --> 00:19:59,75
Nothing in technology works as well as that, so we combine lessons from desert beetle, from cactus

158
00:19:59,75 --> 00:20:08,85
and from pitcher plant and we're able to put together something interesting that neither of them alone will teach us.

159
00:20:09,38 --> 00:20:12,8
Now how many of these capabilities? I'm sure it's endless.

160
00:20:12,8 --> 00:20:14,29
There's so many organisms,

161
00:20:14,29 --> 00:20:24,57
and there are so many things about organisms that nobody has studied yet in endless combination of something that

162
00:20:24,57 --> 00:20:28,21
nature evolved here, because it was important for this organism,

163
00:20:28,21 --> 00:20:36,04
and somewhere else because it was important for another organism, together it gives unusual,

164
00:20:36,05 --> 00:20:42,38
unexpected solution that nobody can easily come up with that concept,

165
00:20:42,7 --> 00:20:54,69
so it's not generally obvious.	We are not trying to go and to try to do the obvious science, it's uneven,

166
00:20:56,51 --> 00:21:02,87
untraditional, unorthodox combinations that we're trying to do.

167
00:21:02,87 --> 00:21:06,33
Speaker 1: And where did it all start for you?

168
00:21:06,33 --> 00:21:14,42
When did your passion for looking at nature, looking at it, where did it start?

169
00:21:14,42 --> 00:21:18,52
Speaker 2: I can't even remember, I think it was always there.

170
00:21:19,73 --> 00:21:33,32
I guess in some ways, there's a little bit of unpleasant beginning of all that when I was a child,

171
00:21:33,32 --> 00:21:35,06
when I was two years old.

172
00:21:35,06 --> 00:21:48,79
It all started when I went to kindergarten, and my nurse in the kindergarten by mistake,

173
00:21:49,18 --> 00:21:57,18
gave me triple dose of vaccine for anti-polio vaccine, at that time, vaccine was alive

174
00:21:57,93 --> 00:22:10,45
and I actually was paralyzed for a number of years.

175
00:22:10,98 --> 00:22:22,14
So when I was paralyzed, I was in the sanatorium, on the black sea and was exposed to shells, to waves,

176
00:22:22,47 --> 00:22:25,64
to black sea at that time.

177
00:22:25,64 --> 00:22:35,56
They were unpleasant times, but at the same time, it was the time when all the kids were running around and playing

178
00:22:35,56 --> 00:22:46,04
and I was in a chair and that was the beginning of looking, observing nature and loving it, really.

179
00:22:46,54 --> 00:22:55,92
Then in school, I guess that, so I was, winner of all the mathematical Olympias,

180
00:22:55,92 --> 00:23:01,91
so science was always something I wanted to do.

181
00:23:01,91 --> 00:23:14,8
It was never a question of which science, but I guess that my parents, who were very influential for me,

182
00:23:14,81 --> 00:23:22,48
we constantly had discussions and some fights between them, whether I would follow my dad's steps or my mom's steps,

183
00:23:24,65 --> 00:23:27,15
and I decided to combine both.

184
00:23:28,19 --> 00:23:34,65
My mom was a medical doctor, specifically interested in infectious diseases,

185
00:23:34,65 --> 00:23:46,98
and I do now a lot of work in making materials from medical devices that prevent infections that prevent bacteria to

186
00:23:46,98 --> 00:23:51,63
form, and my dad is a structural engineers.

187
00:23:51,63 --> 00:24:00,21
He always wanted me to be an engineer, and this combination is actually really interesting, and I guess that's,

188
00:24:00,21 --> 00:24:10,78
as I mentioned, I can track it back a time when I was three or four years old.

189
00:24:10,78 --> 00:24:15,99
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then looking at the shells when you were in this chair,

190
00:24:15,99 --> 00:24:22,82
in what way- that was the only thing you could, do of course. You could see the sea, you could smell the sea.

191
00:24:22,82 --> 00:24:25,54
Speaker 2: That's right. I'm sorry.

192
00:24:25,54 --> 00:24:39,74
What always interested me, and it's something that probably, I keep doing it 'til now, is pattern information.

193
00:24:39,74 --> 00:24:50,18
It's not only seashells, let's say, but the, how waves leave interesting signs on the sand.

194
00:24:50,66 --> 00:25:02,81
So these rhombii in the patterns left behind by the waves on the sand was my obsession for a very long time.

195
00:25:02,82 --> 00:25:11,04
So since I was most interested in mathematics as a student in school,

196
00:25:11,06 --> 00:25:21,94
I actually thought that I would be applied mathematician, but then I was convinced that by doing physical chemistry,

197
00:25:21,94 --> 00:25:28,51
I could still do a lot of mathematics, but I can also do physics, chemistry, and biology,

198
00:25:28,51 --> 00:25:39,69
and it was quite a convincing augment to get to the Moscow university to the chemistry department.

199
00:25:40,2 --> 00:25:51,15
So it's patterned information, how different features form and many things in my research, in particular,

200
00:25:51,15 --> 00:25:59,84
patterns in these photonic crystals, or patterns on this sponge, if you see, probably,

201
00:25:59,84 --> 00:26:02,92
that the patterns on this sponge are extremely-

202
00:26:02,92 --> 00:26:03,9
Speaker 1: Can you get it a bit closer for the camera?

203
00:26:03,9 --> 00:26:16,19
Speaker 2: So if you look at that, it's not living anymore, but it's a natural sponge, it's fully, this skeleton of it,

204
00:26:16,19 --> 00:26:25,64
it's fully made of glass, just like we make our buildings and our windows, but I hope, you see,

205
00:26:26,07 --> 00:26:32,31
that in addition to just beautiful glass architecture, it is still irregular.

206
00:26:32,86 --> 00:26:43,21
It has something like a chessboard structure, so there's one window and another one is closed, and it's, again,

207
00:26:43,72 --> 00:26:44,46
pattern.

208
00:26:44,47 --> 00:26:55,00
I was interested when I started to look at that, how this symmetry, that can arise from a living organism,

209
00:26:55,01 --> 00:27:01,08
how can it form a skeleton with such an incredible regularity.

210
00:27:01,09 --> 00:27:07,75
If you look here, there are also diagonal elements running through the sponge,

211
00:27:08,31 --> 00:27:13,62
and they're running exactly every four square. Every four square.

212
00:27:13,96 --> 00:27:25,98
Every second square, it has a dark square, so there's an incredible regularity, so the origin of these features,

213
00:27:25,98 --> 00:27:40,52
the origin of this order, is all within the, our status of how patterns, how interesting assembly works.

214
00:27:40,52 --> 00:27:47,2
Speaker 1: And what did you do with the information you got from this sponge? What did you apply with it?

215
00:27:47,2 --> 00:27:49,2
Did it allure you or what?

216
00:27:49,2 --> 00:28:02,27
Speaker 2: So this is, there's a couple of things that we are trying to do, hopefully, is to,

217
00:28:02,27 --> 00:28:03,58
what we do is we simplify this sponge design, so these are 3D printed,

218
00:28:03,58 --> 00:28:13,37
and this one has all the structural elements this sponge has. This one has a little bit less, this one.

219
00:28:13,56 --> 00:28:25,4
So we make different types of this structure to understand why nature ended up with this specific architecture to make

220
00:28:25,4 --> 00:28:29,84
the most mechanically strong material.

221
00:28:30,39 --> 00:28:42,61
So the lessons that we learn from that is how to make most mechanically strong glass that one can arrange from very

222
00:28:42,61 --> 00:28:44,27
small scale to very large scale.

223
00:28:44,73 --> 00:28:57,33
So then this sponge, in fact, I gave couple of lectures describing that if you look at this from every level,

224
00:28:57,4 --> 00:29:12,82
I can probably teach entire class of civil engineering, and everything we use in the design, laminated materials

225
00:29:16,08 --> 00:29:23,18
or fiber-enforced materials or cemented structures, everything.

226
00:29:23,18 --> 00:29:30,86
Every element that we use now is actually already used by this sponge. So it's a lot of interesting things.

227
00:29:30,86 --> 00:29:37,32
Whether it's additional features, in particular, hierarchy, how nature makes it from mammoth scale,

228
00:29:37,32 --> 00:29:45,1
up to this macroscopic scale to avoid corns that the sponge has in the sea.

229
00:29:45,57 --> 00:29:51,83
So there is a lot of interesting lessons, but again, there's lesson in multi-functionality.

230
00:29:53,06 --> 00:30:05,6
This is a skeleton, but it's also, in our opinion, designed to control and optimize three functions, at least.

231
00:30:05,72 --> 00:30:08,88
Which is, has to be strong, because it's skeleton,

232
00:30:08,88 --> 00:30:18,4
but it also- these are optical fibers that couple light into this structure,

233
00:30:18,41 --> 00:30:21,52
most of them I already removed from my research.

234
00:30:21,52 --> 00:30:30,96
So the structure has to act as a beacon in the sea, so how one can use glass to make optical fibers

235
00:30:30,96 --> 00:30:40,81
and also skeletons out of glass in natural conditions, not the two-thousand degree sea as we deal with glass,

236
00:30:40,81 --> 00:30:47,00
but in addition to that, sponge is a primitive organism, sponges breath

237
00:30:47,66 --> 00:30:55,31
and feed by pumping seawater through this openings.

238
00:30:55,31 --> 00:31:07,86
All these openings in its structure is for pumping seawater, then organic particles that are coming through this body,

239
00:31:08,4 --> 00:31:16,37
are uptaken and [inaudible 00:31:10] by this primitive, it's not even a- it's a multicellular organism,

240
00:31:16,38 --> 00:31:20,15
but it doesn't have organs, it's nothing, it's really primitive.

241
00:31:20,15 --> 00:31:29,7
However, it's able and combining optical properties, mechanical properties, and what we believe, the design,

242
00:31:29,7 --> 00:31:35,57
with this nice structure of opening one pore, closing another one,

243
00:31:36,18 --> 00:31:47,9
is heading served function to optimize fluidics so that it doesn't need to use too much energy to pump water through

244
00:31:47,9 --> 00:31:52,91
this structure so that some windows are open more than others.

245
00:31:52,91 --> 00:32:00,9
And in addition to that, I don't know how much you could see, but there are two white things inside,

246
00:32:00,9 --> 00:32:07,06
you can probably maybe can get it out, maybe.

247
00:32:07,06 --> 00:32:12,76
That's very sticky, so very difficult to get it out, maybe now you can see them better.

248
00:32:13,05 --> 00:32:23,61
This is part of the claw of a shrimp that lives inside the sponge.	Symbiotically with the sponge,

249
00:32:23,61 --> 00:32:34,42
so we learn a lot about natural symbiotic life, of how to make mechanically strong materials, and optical fibers,

250
00:32:35,05 --> 00:32:47,28
and it's all designed for these shrimp to be protected from environments where nobody can catch them and eat them,

251
00:32:47,28 --> 00:32:54,75
but for shrimp to be able to eat, needs food, so how would the shrimp get the food?

252
00:32:55,32 --> 00:33:02,96
The optical fibers provide enough illumination so everything is attracted to light.

253
00:33:02,96 --> 00:33:06,55
I would come of that, there's always feast.

254
00:33:07,49 --> 00:33:12,09
So they have more than enough food, and the products of their life cycle,

255
00:33:12,1 --> 00:33:23,4
so all their excrements are used by sponge for its own feeding, so really interesting ideas.

256
00:33:23,41 --> 00:33:34,33
However, what if and we are thinking about it, but I'll know whether it would be, after all, the outcome of that,

257
00:33:34,33 --> 00:33:40,47
but what if we look at that and we think about a future building.

258
00:33:41,02 --> 00:33:49,89
So this building, this 3d printed version, has every structural element that this sponge has.

259
00:33:50,21 --> 00:33:53,87
This sponge is also a building because shrimp lives inside.

260
00:33:54,32 --> 00:34:03,56
But what if we would actually use the idea of energy saving ideas, the sponge has already evolved,

261
00:34:03,56 --> 00:34:10,61
which is in this case, to pump water through the system, but in this case,

262
00:34:10,62 --> 00:34:21,44
it could be a building where size of the openings of some of the windows would be opened for airflow for wind so that

263
00:34:21,44 --> 00:34:28,58
you could have the most efficient energy balance of the building, but at the same time, mechanically,

264
00:34:29,08 --> 00:34:36,12
it would have all of these diagonal elements, you can see the end, one open, one closed, so that mechanically,

265
00:34:36,77 --> 00:34:42,64
it's very strong, but it's actually, on top of that, aesthetically very pleasing.

266
00:34:42,65 --> 00:34:47,09
What if this building, this is lesson from sponge,

267
00:34:47,09 --> 00:34:55,78
but what if this building would also have lessons that we can take from butterflies

268
00:34:55,78 --> 00:35:05,87
and this building will change color due to the liquid coming through certain places and during rain,

269
00:35:07,3 --> 00:35:16,1
it would reveal certain messages and you would see a dynamic color change as natural conditions change.

270
00:35:16,11 --> 00:35:20,34
Or the windows, yet another project that we like,

271
00:35:20,64 --> 00:35:30,74
would have this ability to control the light intensity so we really think about as not anywhere close yet,

272
00:35:30,74 --> 00:35:44,05
but we think about building, that's why I'm probably coughing, because it's so far away,

273
00:35:44,05 --> 00:35:47,3
but it's difficult to imagine that we're anywhere close,

274
00:35:47,3 --> 00:35:56,46
but what if our future would be materials that combine smart solutions from completely different organisms,

275
00:35:56,46 --> 00:35:59,93
and that gives us environments, materials,

276
00:35:59,93 --> 00:36:14,9
and entire architecture that is capable of most efficient way control airflow, to control resistance of ice formation,

277
00:36:15,31 --> 00:36:26,69
to control optical properties, reconfigure, change depending on which side it is.

278
00:36:26,99 --> 00:36:34,65
Depending on what part of the world this building is going to be built in.

279
00:36:34,98 --> 00:36:46,37
So that's, if I were to dream big, this is what I hope we can make this building out of interesting puzzles

280
00:36:46,37 --> 00:36:56,59
and interesting ideas that nature has created and nature has evolved and probably waiting for us to uncover.

281
00:36:56,59 --> 00:36:59,25
Speaker 1: When did you discover this sponge?

282
00:36:59,25 --> 00:37:00,59
Speaker 2: Sponge, um-

283
00:37:00,59 --> 00:37:02,92
Speaker 1: How did you find it?

284
00:37:02,92 --> 00:37:11,8
Speaker 2: So, it's, I was very interested in sponges long time ago

285
00:37:11,8 --> 00:37:22,00
when I was a student in the Weizmann Institute.	Should I- where do you want me to hold it?

286
00:37:22,00 --> 00:37:28,74
Speaker 3: You can come as close as you want to the camera, it's nice for me. Yup, okay.

287
00:37:28,74 --> 00:37:29,36
Speaker 2: Okay.

288
00:37:29,36 --> 00:37:31,62
Speaker 1: So the glass fiber, how does that work?

289
00:37:31,62 --> 00:37:39,27
Speaker 2: So this sponge, when it's alive, it's coated with a thin layer of brownish cells,

290
00:37:39,58 --> 00:37:49,17
but all these windows are actually open for bumping water through it, but it's attached to ocean floor right here,

291
00:37:49,17 --> 00:37:55,25
what is called holdfast apparatus, but it has multiple function.

292
00:37:55,25 --> 00:38:04,00
So not only holds it inside the floor, but at the end of each of these fibers, so these are optical fibers.

293
00:38:04,00 --> 00:38:10,64
There's a crown of optical fibers surrounding this bunch, just this crown is,

294
00:38:11,39 --> 00:38:23,13
has the wavelengths of light associated with the bioluminescent material that lives in the ocean floor,

295
00:38:23,53 --> 00:38:28,76
and the light produced by this bacteria is coupled into these fibers

296
00:38:29,46 --> 00:38:34,13
and it shines really similar to these fiber-optical lens.

297
00:38:34,13 --> 00:38:39,13
Speaker 1: Can you take it, 'cause I can't go there with my camera.

298
00:38:39,13 --> 00:38:47,96
Speaker 2: A lot coming from bacterias, coupled to these lenses, and the end of each of these, of this fiber,

299
00:38:48,64 --> 00:39:00,33
there is a lens for efficient coupling of light, and it shines very similar to these optical fibers that we all know

300
00:39:00,33 --> 00:39:08,74
and we think that we invented fiberoptics just 60 years ago or so, but in fact,

301
00:39:09,19 --> 00:39:16,09
this is one of the oldest organisms that exist and they knew how to make fiber-optical things back then,

302
00:39:17,39 --> 00:39:27,86
so it's really the same principle, is the structure of these fibers would have a higher index core

303
00:39:28,12 --> 00:39:35,83
and lower index cladding, and the signal goes through the center of the fiber and shines at the end.

304
00:39:35,99 --> 00:39:42,23
It actually shines many places, because it actually shines almost like Christmas tree,

305
00:39:42,52 --> 00:39:56,93
because it has major point where light coming off is on the tip that some of these fibers have branches,.

306
00:39:49,58 --> 00:39:56,71
and these also highlight it due to the out-coupling of light in these [rotations 00:39:56]

307
00:39:56,93 --> 00:39:58,28
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's very deep.

308
00:39:58,28 --> 00:40:01,11
Speaker 2: It's deeper in the ocean, there is no sunlight there,

309
00:40:01,44 --> 00:40:07,07
so the only light that is coming are from the ocean floor.

310
00:40:07,07 --> 00:40:16,4
Now maybe you could see, I hope you could see, one second, there are two, here's inside this sponge,

311
00:40:16,4 --> 00:40:28,93
these two wide things. If you see them, if you can focus on them, or I can try to wiggle them around.

312
00:40:28,93 --> 00:40:35,16
These are claws of the shrimp that lives inside.

313
00:40:35,83 --> 00:40:45,22
So one may say that, compared to shrimp that is freely swimming, it is a disadvantage because they cannot swim

314
00:40:45,22 --> 00:40:50,33
and find food, but it's actually an advantage.

315
00:40:50,55 --> 00:40:58,04
First advantage is pretty much nothing can crunch this extremely strong material, so the mechanic will protect it.

316
00:40:58,04 --> 00:41:09,89
There is no enemies, really, for the shrimp. They may want to, but they cannot crash the glass.

317
00:41:10,54 --> 00:41:22,64
Now food comes from the fact that this is, as a fiber-optical lamp, it's enough light in this area,

318
00:41:22,64 --> 00:41:27,97
in the ocean so that anything living is always attracted to light,

319
00:41:28,53 --> 00:41:38,35
and the density of food that the shrimp can eat is pretty high, and in this way,

320
00:41:38,51 --> 00:41:52,8
it is a nice combination of symbiotic life between bioluminescent material, sponge, and the shrimp that lives inside

321
00:41:52,81 --> 00:42:03,06
and none of them alone would be able to survive especially in the conditions where there is almost no light

322
00:42:03,5 --> 00:42:10,16
and food is really depleted as you go deeper and deeper in the ocean,

323
00:42:10,16 --> 00:42:14,00
but together it produces a very interesting system.

324
00:42:14,7 --> 00:42:23,75
So that's how we think about new materials, new designs of combining things together

325
00:42:23,75 --> 00:42:38,36
and thinking how different organisms can teach us something that current materials or current devices don't use yet..

326
00:42:34,29 --> 00:42:38,02
Just because it's, you see how- [inaudible 00:42:40]

327
00:42:38,36 --> 00:42:50,42
I wouldn't recommend fetching this to you up close because it would immediately attack.

328
00:42:50,42 --> 00:43:00,21
It's amazing, it's another feature, it has an incredible ability better than velcro to attach anything.

329
00:43:00,21 --> 00:43:06,00
Speaker 1: So could you, you have three labs.

330
00:43:06,00 --> 00:43:12,52
Speaker 2: Yes. I have one lab in three different locations.

331
00:43:12,52 --> 00:43:18,84
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you describe the three different locations, what are the differences?

332
00:43:18,84 --> 00:43:27,75
Speaker 2: So the difference really, I would still probably prefer everything to be in one location,

333
00:43:28,09 --> 00:43:34,94
so that people talk to shells, that even a lot, we almost have a lot of activities together.

334
00:43:35,37 --> 00:43:43,86
In some ways, it's divided by topics, maybe.

335
00:43:43,86 --> 00:43:57,28
Not many topics, but generally speaking, I would say in my lab, the lab that is here in the engineering building,

336
00:43:57,28 --> 00:44:07,25
there's a lot of projects that are related to dynamic materials to self-assembly to making colorful materials,

337
00:44:07,85 --> 00:44:20,42
responsive materials, and it has a lot of work with more than pigments, optical devices, and so on.

338
00:44:20,63 --> 00:44:33,95
It's one lab, thinking about the ways one can, for example, just another paper that was on the cover of a journal,

339
00:44:34,38 --> 00:44:40,21
How to Make Materials Assemble, absolutely interesting patterns.

340
00:44:40,21 --> 00:44:52,07
So that is in one lab, and it's very generally described, I would say, as self-assembly and dynamic response materials,

341
00:44:52,07 --> 00:44:54,94
a lot of synthesis is done in this lab.

342
00:44:54,94 --> 00:45:08,48
My, another lab is doing a lot of research in filing materials, but specifically, more biological materials,

343
00:45:08,48 --> 00:45:15,03
so using pitcher plant as an inspiration to make materials that repel ice,

344
00:45:15,03 --> 00:45:28,14
materials that can be used in heat exchanges, prevent fouling, generally, but it's a lot of studies of what is it,

345
00:45:28,14 --> 00:45:33,74
why they people like that, what would be the fundamental science and physical

346
00:45:33,74 --> 00:45:44,54
and chemical principles to understand which one should do, talk to my stem, where does performance come from,

347
00:45:44,54 --> 00:45:56,06
and it's really fluidics and materials' characterization related to wetting phenomenon.

348
00:45:56,06 --> 00:46:05,8
Will these surfaces, will these structures that may be wet by different media.

349
00:46:05,8 --> 00:46:15,31
And the third lab is somewhat related to second, but it's more on biological fouling.

350
00:46:15,89 --> 00:46:24,02
So not necessarily fouling, it would be a wrong thing to say fouling. I would say by a, NANA interfaces.

351
00:46:24,02 --> 00:46:36,61
So in some cases, we want to repel things, for example, we want to repel bacteria, we want to repel mussels

352
00:46:37,27 --> 00:46:42,59
and barnacles from ships in the ocean, but in other cases,

353
00:46:42,59 --> 00:46:50,6
it could be to create materials on which we can harvest algae for [anaegic 00:46:48] production, but it's again,

354
00:46:50,6 --> 00:46:53,5
there's a lot of questions one can ask.

355
00:46:54,06 --> 00:46:57,7
One you need to harvest them so they feel comfortable,

356
00:46:57,7 --> 00:47:07,3
but then you need to have ways to release them from the structures and surfaces that are used for their production,

357
00:47:07,3 --> 00:47:16,81
so the third lab is mostly related to growing bacterial cultures, growing algae in the laboratory solutions,

358
00:47:16,81 --> 00:47:26,9
laboratory conditions, and identifying the structure, how they interact with materials that we make

359
00:47:26,9 --> 00:47:35,00
and to really come up with recipes for different applications.

360
00:47:35,00 --> 00:47:43,23
So one can say that we have a general approach that we learned from the pitcher plant.

361
00:47:43,85 --> 00:47:46,92
It's what's called platform technology.

362
00:47:47,66 --> 00:47:53,68
I's really, there are parts of that that can be combined in different ways,

363
00:47:54,07 --> 00:48:01,67
depending whether you want to do it on glass or on metal, and depending whether you want to repel marine things,

364
00:48:02,2 --> 00:48:11,04
we want to repel ice so one can use it as a system design with different components depending what you want to do

365
00:48:11,04 --> 00:48:28,08
and we study a lot, how different combinations of materials together give the best outcome for specific target..

366
00:48:22,5 --> 00:48:28,42
Speaker 1: It's so strange that we, you, or other scientists .. [inaudible 00:48:29]

367
00:48:28,42 --> 00:48:31,75
Speaker 2: Oh my god, you are very sensitive.

368
00:48:31,75 --> 00:48:43,68
Speaker 3: His microphone is sensitive. I'm less sensitive.

369
00:48:43,68 --> 00:48:47,05
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting, a cough, but it's, a lot of it's a real endurement. There are cars.

370
00:48:47,05 --> 00:48:51,71
Speaker 1: But it's so strange, when you look for metal, that metal and corrosion.

371
00:48:51,71 --> 00:48:56,93
Speaker 2: There's some things, obviously. Now I'm becoming sensitive.

372
00:48:56,93 --> 00:48:59,81
Speaker 3: We're almost done here. That's good, that's good.

373
00:48:59,81 --> 00:49:04,02
Speaker 1: They're like metal and corrosion which we accepted for tens of, hundreds of years or more,

374
00:49:04,19 --> 00:49:17,54
that you've found this material that you could prove only that it changes.

375
00:49:17,54 --> 00:49:19,89
It's so strange that now we are finding these and not earlier.

376
00:49:19,89 --> 00:49:27,66
Speaker 2: That's true, but I think that we will make a lot of interesting, we as a science in general,

377
00:49:27,87 --> 00:49:30,14
and not talking about my lab only.

378
00:49:30,14 --> 00:49:38,35
If we open our eyes and think in the very non-traditional terms about what we can learn from nature,

379
00:49:38,35 --> 00:49:44,92
we can suddenly realize there are many interesting solutions that we have no idea exist,

380
00:49:44,92 --> 00:49:48,91
and many of them in fact are extremely simple.

381
00:49:48,91 --> 00:49:59,88
In particular, the pitcher plant idea is very simple, but it is counter-intuitive, so if we talk about it and

382
00:49:59,88 --> 00:50:06,63
when I'm trying to explain the system, when I say it's counter-intuitive,

383
00:50:07,25 --> 00:50:17,86
because everything is against the rules that are commonly used in current technologies and well-established rules.

384
00:50:18,59 --> 00:50:33,46
For example, if we think about how to make a material that has as little friction as possible, so the way we do it now,

385
00:50:33,46 --> 00:50:34,51
we polish everything.

386
00:50:34,51 --> 00:50:43,87
We polish so that the surface has a minimum number of defects, because every defects produces friction.

387
00:50:44,5 --> 00:50:51,49
So if we talk about pipes, everything is polished, because otherwise they would create turbulence

388
00:50:51,49 --> 00:50:54,56
when we transport oil or water.

389
00:50:55,8 --> 00:51:05,16
If anywhere else, if we think about the materials that need to get to lowest friction as possible,

390
00:51:05,16 --> 00:51:06,76
we need to get rid of roughness.

391
00:51:07,26 --> 00:51:16,55
Now what pitcher plant is doing is that it actually creates an extremely rough surface.

392
00:51:16,55 --> 00:51:21,53
It is extremely structured surface, which by all laws of physics,

393
00:51:21,93 --> 00:51:31,42
is supposed to be extremely bad if you wanted to produce friction for your material.

394
00:51:31,78 --> 00:51:38,01
However, it is high friction when it's dry, so that ants

395
00:51:38,01 --> 00:51:47,64
or insects are capable of moving around on the surface of this pitcher plant, on a dry day,

396
00:51:48,18 --> 00:51:54,42
being hap- having no idea what may happen when there is rain, but what happens

397
00:51:54,42 --> 00:52:04,7
when there is rain is that this structured surface picks up water because it's hydrophilic, it likes water,

398
00:52:04,7 --> 00:52:16,06
and by picking up water, it creates layer over layer of a liquid that is trapped inside the structure solid.

399
00:52:16,76 --> 00:52:26,49
The outcome of that that you have a structured material, a rough material, but the roughness has a second role.

400
00:52:26,83 --> 00:52:37,71
Its role is to hold water, and at the end, what insects would experience is not the rough surface,

401
00:52:38,21 --> 00:52:47,66
you use rough surface to create ultra smooth surface because your final outcome is the surface of water,

402
00:52:48,28 --> 00:52:50,09
and liquid has no defects.

403
00:52:51,16 --> 00:52:58,83
So that's why I'm saying it's counterintuitive, because we use roughness to get rid of roughness in a way,

404
00:52:59,43 --> 00:53:08,7
and also we use liquid as a material. There is not that many places where liquid can be considered as a material.

405
00:53:09,05 --> 00:53:18,91
It could be used, let's say in 3d printing or anywhere else, to make something out of it,

406
00:53:18,91 --> 00:53:30,33
but the final outcome is a solid. So materials are solids. In this case, liquid is part of it.

407
00:53:30,33 --> 00:53:39,73
Together with solid, it makes a new concept. Liquid alone doesn't do it, solid alone doesn't do it.

408
00:53:40,23 --> 00:53:44,44
But combining these together gives an interesting outcome

409
00:53:44,88 --> 00:53:50,35
and that's why I'm saying it's counterintuitive because we use roughness to get rid of roughness,

410
00:53:50,7 --> 00:54:03,84
and we use liquids stored in a way inside structured surfaces that hold it nicely inside to take advantage of liquids

411
00:54:03,84 --> 00:54:08,00
that otherwise cannot be shaped, cannot, they won't run away.

412
00:54:08,00 --> 00:54:14,85
But now they're inside your material, and they lend the material with its properties.

413
00:54:16,82 --> 00:54:24,51
So this is brittle star, used to have five arms, I just removed one arm for analysis.

414
00:54:24,51 --> 00:54:29,59
So it changes color, not all brittle stars do that but this species does, and during the day it's black.

415
00:54:32,1 --> 00:54:43,5
And the reason it's black during the day is that it has lenses on its surface that regulate the light intensity

416
00:54:43,53 --> 00:54:52,97
depending how much light outside and the receptors under the lens can work only in certain range.

417
00:54:52,97 --> 00:54:58,82
So when it's too bright, they cover the lens with a black pigment

418
00:54:58,82 --> 00:55:05,75
and therefore the entire organism changes color to black, and at night, when actually they are active species,

419
00:55:05,75 --> 00:55:16,01
they are doing everything at night, when it's not enough light, they withdraw the pigment back into the structure,

420
00:55:16,28 --> 00:55:20,14
opening the lenses for more efficient collection of light,

421
00:55:20,15 --> 00:55:29,09
so the color change here is due to the dynamic nature of bringing a liquid in, in this case, pigment,

422
00:55:29,41 --> 00:55:31,41
and then withdrawing it back.

423
00:55:31,41 --> 00:55:40,54
So the idea of bringing liquids in into materials is now a very common theme in many of my projects

424
00:55:40,54 --> 00:55:49,28
and some of them are completely unrelated but it's thinking about liquids in and on materials.

425
00:55:49,28 --> 00:55:57,56
Speaker 1: One question about that brittle fish- why is it during the day, why black and not white, I should say.

426
00:55:57,56 --> 00:56:06,71
Speaker 2: So it's not mimicry, it's not mimicking the environment, and in fact, this is what the beginning,

427
00:56:07,03 --> 00:56:13,96
biological literature was using this as another example of mimicking the environment

428
00:56:13,96 --> 00:56:21,05
and changing the color accordingly. It's actually opposite of what you would expect, and that was a big mistake.

429
00:56:21,05 --> 00:56:26,22
That was what attracted me to this topic, is it's not hiding.

430
00:56:27,35 --> 00:56:32,85
Because it's just being even better seen during the day, and even more so during the night.

431
00:56:32,85 --> 00:56:42,84
The function here is to optimize light collection and therefore during night, you want to get rid of pigment,

432
00:56:42,84 --> 00:56:48,67
and during the day, you want to screen your lenses from excessive light.

433
00:56:48,68 --> 00:56:57,12
So it's not mimicking the color of the environment, it's optimizing its technology, which is in this case,

434
00:56:57,12 --> 00:56:57,85
dynamic lenses.

435
00:56:57,85 --> 00:57:02,02
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you are doing, and biologists is not [inaudible 00:57:02]

436
00:57:02,02 --> 00:57:11,49
Speaker 2: That's correct, so biologists always look for common, they are comfortable, terminology that they used to,

437
00:57:11,88 --> 00:57:17,96
suddenly to tell the story, but no, the entire color change has a completely different function,

438
00:57:18,4 --> 00:57:26,2
and it's to optimize and improve the performance of optical elements, and it's optics, it's not on the skeleton,

439
00:57:26,52 --> 00:57:36,93
and overall thinking that skeleton can also be an optical element is really interesting idea.

440
00:57:36,94 --> 00:57:42,01
Think about buildings that, of course, mechanically strong,

441
00:57:42,2 --> 00:57:52,62
but also have built-in optical structure so the same construction is actually its own optical element that collects

442
00:57:52,62 --> 00:57:58,13
light or reflects light, so it's pretty interesting.

443
00:57:58,13 --> 00:57:58,58
Speaker 1: Yeah.

444
00:57:58,58 --> 00:58:04,94
Sort of the difference between you and a biologist is that when you look at the animals and the organisms,

445
00:58:04,94 --> 00:58:09,99
you look at the characteristics or the functions?

446
00:58:09,99 --> 00:58:18,33
Speaker 2: I say I look more for, if I may say, high-tech properties.

447
00:58:18,33 --> 00:58:23,36
If it's, I'm less interested,

448
00:58:23,36 --> 00:58:32,32
although it's extremely important to understand what are the specific cellular mechanisms that are involved in making

449
00:58:32,32 --> 00:58:39,74
the specific biological structures or what is the biological cell or biology or proteins

450
00:58:39,74 --> 00:58:48,55
or polysaccharides that are involved in these functions. I am more interested in technology.

451
00:58:48,55 --> 00:58:59,78
I'm more interested in devices that became an outcome of the evolution that performed high-tech function,

452
00:58:59,78 --> 00:59:07,46
so I'm interested in mechanics, I'm interested in optics, and I'm interest- but optics beyond eyes.

453
00:59:07,46 --> 00:59:14,66
We're not all about our eyes because we need to know about it, but other interesting optical solutions,

454
00:59:14,67 --> 00:59:21,38
and I'm looking for magnetic structures in nature, how nature makes magnetic materials that are different from us,

455
00:59:21,38 --> 00:59:28,1
so it's really, I would say technical characteristics of biological materials.

456
00:59:28,1 --> 00:59:35,36
Speaker 1: When you look in near future, where are we humans with our technological brain

457
00:59:35,36 --> 00:59:39,54
and technological possibility, where are we going to?

458
00:59:39,54 --> 00:59:43,37
Speaker 2: That's a tough question.

459
00:59:43,37 --> 00:59:50,49
I'm not sure I can say where we're going, I can tell you what I feel would be very important

460
00:59:50,49 --> 01:00:00,67
and what I feel really interesting and which area would be to create technologies,

461
01:00:00,67 --> 01:00:05,89
materials that have the ability to self-assemble, self-assemble,

462
01:00:05,89 --> 01:00:17,66
it uses environment as a trigger for behavioral changes, not to overuse energies,

463
01:00:17,67 --> 01:00:26,32
every time everything is run by hinges, by chain you switch on and off, they may have and this is what organisms do

464
01:00:26,32 --> 01:00:29,05
and I hope the future might be,

465
01:00:29,28 --> 01:00:40,84
to create a range of interesting materials that know how to switch behavior from letting sun in or not, from being,

466
01:00:43,97 --> 01:00:53,04
from accepting water to repelling water. Because in some cases, one is too dry, you really want the water to come in.

467
01:00:53,04 --> 01:00:59,11
You want the building to breathe, but when it's extremely wet, and there's rain every day,

468
01:00:59,58 --> 01:01:01,3
you actually want to repel it,

469
01:01:01,3 --> 01:01:09,51
so how can one create the same material that will change its own function in response to what happens outside?

470
01:01:09,52 --> 01:01:13,23
I think this is the future, it might take on the future.

471
01:01:13,23 --> 01:01:16,42
Speaker 1: Our program is cool to the mind of the universe,

472
01:01:16,42 --> 01:01:27,44
the idea that it's our barriers in accessibility to knowledge are going down through the internet where you're born

473
01:01:27,44 --> 01:01:29,54
and you can learn everything about quantum mechanics.

474
01:01:29,54 --> 01:01:34,78
What do you think about that, have we somehow created cognosphere around our biosphere?

475
01:01:34,78 --> 01:01:41,02
Speaker 2: That's a difficult question.

476
01:01:41,02 --> 01:01:50,51
I watch my grandson, he's almost six years old, but even when he was two,

477
01:01:50,51 --> 01:01:57,93
he was already trying to look on the cellphone and he knew how to move things around and that you,

478
01:01:57,93 --> 01:02:04,54
and he at certain moment, he came to our TV and was trying to open window on the TV and TV was,

479
01:02:04,54 --> 01:02:10,78
he was so surprised that it's not doing it, so there are problems,

480
01:02:10,78 --> 01:02:18,63
maybe with the fact that you don't even need to learn anything, you can have access to any information,

481
01:02:18,63 --> 01:02:20,63
any moment you want it.

482
01:02:20,63 --> 01:02:32,65
However, at the same time, I still hope that there is something that these days, is easier to do than before,

483
01:02:33,03 --> 01:02:44,67
and I hope that we will benefit from that and this is multidisciplinarity, in a way.

484
01:02:44,86 --> 01:02:48,21
So I'm physical chemist by training.

485
01:02:48,21 --> 01:02:55,5
Not an engineer, I'm not a biologist, I'm not a medical doctor, so then I'm a physical chemist.

486
01:02:55,73 --> 01:03:04,69
However, I do a lot of physics, math, architecture and biology and medicine research.

487
01:03:05,08 --> 01:03:07,11
Why that is possible,

488
01:03:07,56 --> 01:03:18,56
is that I feel that none of these disciplines alone are capable of addressing tomorrow's questions adequately,

489
01:03:19,79 --> 01:03:25,23
or have the tools to do it in the most efficient way.

490
01:03:25,65 --> 01:03:39,8
So I feel that when I combine in my group, I try to bring mathematicians, physicists, chemists, medical doctors

491
01:03:40,29 --> 01:03:51,38
and designers together, the goal for that is to think about the way these people would address science in unusual ways.

492
01:03:51,55 --> 01:03:56,29
Just to give you a very simple demonstration of that,

493
01:03:57,81 --> 01:04:08,89
if one wants to describe why this butterfly has these beautiful colors, actually, you pretty much need to know optics.

494
01:04:09,63 --> 01:04:16,05
Physics and optics alone will describe what is happening for this butterfly.

495
01:04:16,33 --> 01:04:25,23
However, all our technological changes, all the improvements that we had, were due to the fact that- okay,

496
01:04:25,23 --> 01:04:26,56
we understand optics.

497
01:04:26,56 --> 01:04:37,33
But what if I now use my chemistry knowledge and I encrypt chemical information inside this structure?

498
01:04:37,8 --> 01:04:44,84
What if now, this optical device would have different chemistries in different locations.

499
01:04:44,98 --> 01:04:51,54
So without chemistry, pretty much anything that we've done with this material, would be absolutely impossible.

500
01:04:51,54 --> 01:05:01,54
Suddenly, chemistry gave a nice spread of applications and possibilities that optics, physics alone couldn't do.

501
01:05:01,54 --> 01:05:09,84
Chemistry alone also couldn't do it, so chemistry with physics, with optics, gave an interesting outcome,

502
01:05:09,84 --> 01:05:15,82
but then yet another area, having a fluid mechanicist in my group,

503
01:05:17,52 --> 01:05:27,96
brought the ideas of how liquids would infiltrate these structures, can move around in interesting ways,

504
01:05:27,96 --> 01:05:39,47
and in this way to create interesting unusual changes in color in response to environment, so in my opinion,

505
01:05:39,97 --> 01:05:52,2
it's very important for kids, for our future, still have very clearly depth in some traditional disciplines.

506
01:05:52,2 --> 01:06:02,5
I would, if I were now to have a high school student choosing what to do, I would say,

507
01:06:02,5 --> 01:06:10,44
begin with choosing one discipline that you will learn very deeply as your first degree.

508
01:06:10,44 --> 01:06:18,25
But then, especially for those who are interested in science and will stay in science, I as a PhD, work

509
01:06:18,25 --> 01:06:24,07
or I would then create teams of different backgrounds coming together

510
01:06:24,07 --> 01:06:29,54
and learning something from another community that you alone wouldn't know otherwise,

511
01:06:29,55 --> 01:06:42,39
so this bringing together expertise, is, I think, the future, and I hope that we will see more and more papers

512
01:06:42,39 --> 01:06:52,74
and technologies that were a clear outcome of multiple disciplines contributing to the aural design.
