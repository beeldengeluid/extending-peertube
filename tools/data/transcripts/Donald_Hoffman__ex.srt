1
00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:12,71
Now the number. He didn't have her number I put it in the email that I sent. You didn't get my email that I didn't see.

2
00:00:14,59 --> 00:00:21,26
And it's good to see you too so I hear you had some time with your grandkids Yeah I did that with us with our great

3
00:00:21,27 --> 00:00:27,22
grandmother she's young knows a lot of planning a great great deal of fun I was goofing around with them

4
00:00:27,23 --> 00:00:30,94
and chasing that was they played with their car one year and so forth

5
00:00:31,19 --> 00:00:35,49
and listen to this her house which was quite nice my three Yeah I.

6
00:00:36,52 --> 00:00:38,75
Think they took off a little bit for a couple hours

7
00:00:38,76 --> 00:00:45,71
and we thought then you only had his play live you know Ryan Ryan thank you Ryan OK.

8
00:00:47,69 --> 00:01:01,03
What was the plan it was allowed Korea OK Sophocles and take any and taking over. And he did well. Well OK. So.

9
00:01:02,18 --> 00:01:06,79
What are we here to do well to talk a bit about.

10
00:01:08,57 --> 00:01:15,79
Science and religion I guess and your thoughts about science and religion and my thoughts and our discussion OK.

11
00:01:17,53 --> 00:01:21,84
I don't know where do we start with science or really with religion Oh well

12
00:01:21,85 --> 00:01:27,71
or maybe we can start with well part part of it is because of the work that I do right is it's on the intersection of

13
00:01:27,72 --> 00:01:31,72
the two and involves of pollution and so forth

14
00:01:31,73 --> 00:01:38,56
and so that that's perhaps something that that you have thoughts about in terms of evolution Oh I have wanted to

15
00:01:38,57 --> 00:01:48,2
thought it out so we can we can start with how all discussion OK so you're interface His between science and.

16
00:01:49,76 --> 00:01:59,98
Philosophy. And religion right OK. OK so so.

17
00:02:00,22 --> 00:02:04,73
We can talk live look at first but your thoughts about evolution we can have a discussion about evolution

18
00:02:05,54 --> 00:02:09,27
and Christianity versus the views I'm working on

19
00:02:09,28 --> 00:02:21,11
and so forth Well I think I come at it from a perspective of science therapy. And religion and.

20
00:02:22,89 --> 00:02:27,91
The Lord has given me some models over the years and I've use with my clients

21
00:02:28,55 --> 00:02:36,16
and have been profoundly helpful to them and so what you've done

22
00:02:36,34 --> 00:02:40,35
and the work that you've done has been very important to me personally

23
00:02:41,23 --> 00:02:54,78
and I've if it's helped me to think about things very differently. And I appreciate that I appreciate the.

24
00:02:55,85 --> 00:03:10,16
Originality of what you've done and I recognize that. The work that you've done has been. It's been done with.

25
00:03:13,36 --> 00:03:21,96
It had to be done persistently. You've always had a I mean you were born with a long attention span.

26
00:03:24,05 --> 00:03:32,92
Your mother and I have remarked about that a lot but this is one of the things I think that that word is used to.

27
00:03:34,89 --> 00:03:45,69
Give you all your insights. And that you're blessed and I and I we marvel at that really appreciate it OK.

28
00:03:46,77 --> 00:03:59,98
This far is the. The business about evolution is concerned. What you have done in my opinion. Is that you've provided.

29
00:04:00,5 --> 00:04:15,36
An ontology. That makes it possible for. A born again Christian and it. To operate in the same direction. And.

30
00:04:16,47 --> 00:04:26,12
The model so that you know that you have come up with that you've used are powerful and to be in that.

31
00:04:27,3 --> 00:04:40,13
It goes counter to. The ontology that is has basically had a monopoly. In our world and that's physicalism.

32
00:04:41,2 --> 00:04:50,23
And time but you've you've proven you're not providing an alternative to that right which I certainly appreciate.

33
00:04:51,33 --> 00:05:03,35
And as far as therapy is concerned I see this opening up the way for integration helping people to integrate which is a

34
00:05:03,36 --> 00:05:06,1
very healthy faith psychologically.

35
00:05:07,14 --> 00:05:16,35
And so I've been kind of working on that aspect of your work right OK and enjoying it very much.

36
00:05:17,37 --> 00:05:24,71
I'm I'm in the process of trying to put her all together and make sense of OK right now. But.

37
00:05:26,6 --> 00:05:30,17
So I come at it from a science perspective figured.

38
00:05:31,77 --> 00:05:38,43
Born Again Christian perspective the therapeutic course perspective and what Or I've been.

39
00:05:39,96 --> 00:05:49,53
Working is in models that integrate OK So you asked the question that's the answer for me right yeah

40
00:05:49,54 --> 00:05:52,3
and I can understand that not all of G.

41
00:05:52,6 --> 00:05:59,94
That comes out of my work is very very you know I mean able to a Christian ontology in the sense that.

42
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:06,45
You don't like physicalism and I'm showing the effect with physicalism is false so that really.

43
00:06:07,56 --> 00:06:11,34
Does work pretty well there but I use evolution and you know

44
00:06:11,35 --> 00:06:18,25
and I know we've had discussions about evolution that were for you're not in in favor of abortion so any thoughts about

45
00:06:18,26 --> 00:06:24,27
that I'm using yeah that the theory of evolution itself pretty strongly to the company's ninety Classic list I've

46
00:06:24,58 --> 00:06:38,29
pondered when you took that tack I pondered. What was going on there but what you did was to. Show that.

47
00:06:40,59 --> 00:06:51,46
Truth and fitness are are are not necessarily the same thing right and that truth will go to extinction when.

48
00:06:53,36 --> 00:07:02,13
One fitness fitness will be their fitness will win OK. And. But.

49
00:07:03,93 --> 00:07:15,62
This is the this is the the problem the context in which you're operating it's not big enough OK because the context

50
00:07:15,63 --> 00:07:21,5
nice to be expanded because there is a spiritual side to life OK

51
00:07:22,43 --> 00:07:34,53
and that spiritual side is a term that the context of the. Physical context is going to pass away for all of us OK.

52
00:07:35,58 --> 00:07:45,05
But there is a spiritual context and I'm a large but help me do it well a mile that puts that all together

53
00:07:45,76 --> 00:07:59,98
and evolution then becomes. A subset or a one way of looking at what things are OK and I you turn.

54
00:08:00,01 --> 00:08:19,99
Beyond to that when you. Shared with me about the concept of the evolution of. Zero. Basically life OK.

55
00:08:21,76 --> 00:08:37,39
And so to me evolution is a result of limitation of perspective OK So the first back did needs to be bigger OK And I

56
00:08:37,4 --> 00:08:39,82
think that I've got some thoughts about that

57
00:08:39,87 --> 00:08:48,66
and I'm working on that right so I don't see that there is a problem with evolution I just think that it's.

58
00:08:50,71 --> 00:08:57,27
A limitation of a bigger Oh concept right OK.

59
00:08:58,42 --> 00:09:03,96
That's that's going to hear so you ask Right right that's so it's

60
00:09:04,04 --> 00:09:11,99
and I agree with that eventually this theory of consciously agents could have therapeutic implications I mean if we

61
00:09:12,00 --> 00:09:14,69
actually understand the principles by which consciousness evolves and

62
00:09:15,47 --> 00:09:22,63
and so forth then it could actually lead to better understanding of our unconscious dynamics and you know

63
00:09:22,64 --> 00:09:25,92
and new new therapeutic techniques certainly can

64
00:09:25,93 --> 00:09:31,92
and it certainly is an ontology that's compatible more compatible with many religious points of view much more than

65
00:09:31,93 --> 00:09:32,66
physicalism right

66
00:09:32,67 --> 00:09:41,28
and so rejecting physicalism does give many religious groups that what they really prize the most which is a different

67
00:09:41,29 --> 00:09:50,65
ontology and a non physicalist ontology Well like I said the different ontology is crucial record and in my opinion.

68
00:09:51,77 --> 00:10:03,48
But leaving the just leaving the place. At the evolutionary. Respective. Is only.

69
00:10:04,66 --> 00:10:10,72
A very limited view of a bigger picture and in the bigger picture.

70
00:10:12,03 --> 00:10:22,39
When one more operating a part prove God then the further we are apart from God the last truth we have access to so

71
00:10:22,4 --> 00:10:32,78
basically I see evolution as be what you cut you can come to when your assumption is that God is not.

72
00:10:36,19 --> 00:10:43,16
Thinking OK So you're saying that if we take an atheistic position then we'll come to evolution Yeah.

73
00:10:45,71 --> 00:10:53,25
Right now I mean that's one. Proceeding OK. But perhaps not the only again for example C.S.

74
00:10:53,26 --> 00:11:04,5
Lewis also believed in evolution. Yeah well. Scripture does not. You think it doesn't know. The.

75
00:11:05,61 --> 00:11:14,4
Creation and not evolution and it's very clear studying the scripture as a born again Christian.

76
00:11:16,22 --> 00:11:23,1
Spiritual things are spiritually discerned at spectrum and that's been my experience.

77
00:11:25,01 --> 00:11:34,85
As I've had a chance to walk with him more. What he's done is to. Put things put knowledge of spiritual context.

78
00:11:36,45 --> 00:11:42,54
When you put knowledge into spiritual context I mean I didn't quite say spiritual I'm talking about born again

79
00:11:42,58 --> 00:11:51,01
Christian Biblical context then you get a different understanding. Then putting it in a human context.

80
00:11:52,58 --> 00:11:59,74
And evolution is knowledge that's been put in a human context not a god the context.

81
00:12:01,3 --> 00:12:09,78
And so you know it's it's true when you're in this context I mean you can you could come to that conclusion

82
00:12:09,79 --> 00:12:17,54
when you're in. A kernel context but you can't come to that conclusion in the biblical context.

83
00:12:19,46 --> 00:12:25,1
And I agree that in Ultimately one could argue that I've used evolution.

84
00:12:26,38 --> 00:12:27,79
To show that evolution is false

85
00:12:27,8 --> 00:12:32,34
and there for a shot myself in the foot right a cut myself into a logical bind I start with evolution

86
00:12:32,78 --> 00:12:34,67
and up destroying physicalism

87
00:12:35,37 --> 00:12:43,57
but evolution in that in biology in involves belief in physicalism there I actually have a lot of fun with that writes

88
00:12:43,9 --> 00:12:44,63
so but

89
00:12:44,64 --> 00:12:50,47
but of course if I'm actually caught in that kind of logical paradox that I've actually destroyed myself in the process

90
00:12:50,54 --> 00:12:58,59
but I know you're not right right I'm actually using just the abstract algorithm of evolution you know the what that

91
00:12:59,23 --> 00:13:02,6
Dawkins call Universal Darwinism to

92
00:13:02,87 --> 00:13:08,55
and that's what's kept you can evolutionary gain through I use that to destroy the physicalism of of evolution

93
00:13:08,56 --> 00:13:15,57
but I guess so I agree that you know many religions including Christianity would love the intelligent that's coming out

94
00:13:15,58 --> 00:13:21,12
of this but I guess the place we're there is a difference between the scientific attitude

95
00:13:21,13 --> 00:13:25,83
and the religious attitude on it is actually in the attitude toward.

96
00:13:27,94 --> 00:13:37,01
Infallible scriptures right in the attitude of science is always the attitude I could be wrong everything I say I could

97
00:13:37,02 --> 00:13:45,13
be wrong whereas the an attitude that you often see in religions is you know our book is absolutely right letter for

98
00:13:45,14 --> 00:13:53,15
letter perfect and couldn't be wrong so that So I think that what I'm offering is half what Christianity would like

99
00:13:53,32 --> 00:13:59,79
and half what it wouldn't like right because the other half of what half is physicalism is dead which is I think.

100
00:14:00,41 --> 00:14:03,83
What percent really likes the other half is.

101
00:14:05,54 --> 00:14:12,14
There are no books that can't be questioned and no words

102
00:14:12,15 --> 00:14:16,51
and books that that shouldn't be be question so that you know that and

103
00:14:16,52 --> 00:14:24,32
when someone says that they have no word from God to two that we're in a position to even question that so Suppose

104
00:14:24,55 --> 00:14:29,67
suppose I came out and said I've got a word from God And it's it's absolutely.

105
00:14:30,79 --> 00:14:37,45
Unconscionable for women to talk in church they shouldn't even be able to ask questions I said that's my word from God.

106
00:14:39,16 --> 00:14:46,3
If it's not in agreement with the word it's not a word from God That's right so is if I said that you would feel like

107
00:14:46,31 --> 00:14:53,51
well you know I'm claiming that it's a word from God But you know it's probably just me I would toss it out you toss it

108
00:14:53,52 --> 00:15:03,08
out now you know we're my nation to. Examine all anything that comes as a word from God.

109
00:15:04,25 --> 00:15:10,37
And the three There are three tests given enough first period his fourteen.

110
00:15:11,47 --> 00:15:18,5
Percent three that say first of all a word from God is going to be edified is going to build you up

111
00:15:19,01 --> 00:15:24,38
and not tear you down and secondly it's going to encourage you in the faith

112
00:15:24,66 --> 00:15:31,99
and not discourage from the right number three it's going to be covered which means it's going to be appropriate for

113
00:15:32,00 --> 00:15:43,27
the aid that faces you right now OK So those are tests that were required as as boarding increases baptize an illusion

114
00:15:43,28 --> 00:15:49,46
period to use to determine that there are there are three other tests

115
00:15:50,28 --> 00:15:55,57
and one of them is been mentioned that is it is from God it's going to agree with Scripture

116
00:15:56,52 --> 00:15:59,97
but also if it's going to have a witness of the.

117
00:16:00,12 --> 00:16:09,38
If spirit inside you're going to know inside that the Holy Spirit is saying yeah so there is a witness of this fair

118
00:16:09,51 --> 00:16:11,01
agreement with the word

119
00:16:11,35 --> 00:16:21,18
and then how God works so he's turning his providential dealing out in our life to situations that we've come to have

120
00:16:21,19 --> 00:16:21,97
to deal with

121
00:16:22,55 --> 00:16:31,84
when all three of those wind up then you have a high degree of confidence that you're being guided by God OK Now most

122
00:16:31,85 --> 00:16:32,53
Christians.

123
00:16:33,98 --> 00:16:40,87
Particularly the ones that we deal with don't have a clue about that kind of stuff OK but the

124
00:16:40,97 --> 00:16:46,3
but the one that I proposed you know that's like I'm here I say that you know it's it's really you know appropriate for

125
00:16:46,31 --> 00:16:53,88
women to ever talk to even ask questions in church that would sort of fail all those all those tests Yeah so it's not a

126
00:16:53,89 --> 00:16:59,49
word from Riyadh. But it's first Corinthians fourteen thirty four word for word.

127
00:17:00,98 --> 00:17:06,89
But the very same chapter you quoted for the principles for what is it worked from God In verse thirty four the very

128
00:17:06,9 --> 00:17:13,09
same chapter says exactly this Paul said women may not speak at all in the church

129
00:17:13,59 --> 00:17:16,89
and they're not allowed to ask questions it's not appropriate

130
00:17:17,37 --> 00:17:20,44
and he said if anybody wants to question me this is the Word of God.

131
00:17:21,68 --> 00:17:27,47
Now my own attitude about it is that it does fail the very principles that you proposed

132
00:17:28,02 --> 00:17:34,21
and that therefore that particular passage is even though it's word for word there Paul says for First Corinthians

133
00:17:34,22 --> 00:17:43,33
fourteen thirty four women cannot talk in church to their credit no church obeys that every church says effectively

134
00:17:43,5 --> 00:17:49,6
forget that that's not the Word of God It's the word of a man who needs psychotherapy he had some issues about women he

135
00:17:49,61 --> 00:17:50,18
needed help

136
00:17:50,78 --> 00:17:57,99
and so that's that's the kind of attitude I'm proposing about looking at the Bible itself right that we have to take

137
00:17:58,00 --> 00:17:59,98
the parts take a burst by worst when.

138
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:04,15
Says Love your neighbor as yourself fabulous I'm all for that but

139
00:18:04,16 --> 00:18:10,68
when Paul says women cannot speak in church to their credit no church listens to him every church says forget that

140
00:18:11,18 --> 00:18:19,12
and so I think churches are in fact doing what I'm suggesting which is to take each verse way according to the kind of

141
00:18:19,13 --> 00:18:24,75
quitter and you were talking about and sometimes rejecting the false as because it's unlucky we had issues

142
00:18:24,87 --> 00:18:28,66
or he was mistaking a cultural norm for the Word of God.

143
00:18:29,76 --> 00:18:37,44
Which is another cultural norms are not the Word of God To start I don't know what you would think about that kind of

144
00:18:37,45 --> 00:18:45,73
argument well. What I would share about that is that the Old Testament and the New Testament.

145
00:18:46,75 --> 00:18:51,49
If you look at them they don't agree err I mean in the test

146
00:18:51,5 --> 00:18:57,19
but yeah if you didn't obey the law you know after Abraham if you didn't obey the law

147
00:18:57,23 --> 00:19:09,38
or Moses did obey the law then you were dealt with harshly OK. But everything changed at the cross and.

148
00:19:11,08 --> 00:19:23,75
Jesus took care of all of our sin that's all take care of past present and future and. That's scriptural. And so.

149
00:19:25,33 --> 00:19:37,24
You know you have to take. Scripture and. And have and deal with the Holy Spirit taking into consideration. Culture.

150
00:19:39,13 --> 00:19:45,36
And the understanding of it God was working in right there. I mean.

151
00:19:46,38 --> 00:19:50,96
For us the Bible says certain things but we have to take that knowledge

152
00:19:51,19 --> 00:19:59,12
and put it put me in the context of together understanding and so.

153
00:20:00,1 --> 00:20:08,39
You know we've all seen in short a war you got so we'll have a problem with it so that for that verse from Paul so my

154
00:20:08,4 --> 00:20:12,68
attitude would be that. I learned a lot of good things from Saint Paul.

155
00:20:13,94 --> 00:20:20,92
And but he's a human being and he had cultural influences and he also made mistakes then he wrote them down

156
00:20:21,46 --> 00:20:26,24
and I think you know religious people can just be intelligent about and take a book like the Bible

157
00:20:26,62 --> 00:20:29,21
and look for the things in it that will really help them

158
00:20:29,62 --> 00:20:33,64
and then see other stuff like Paul saying women should be silent and say you know what.

159
00:20:34,81 --> 00:20:36,49
At best that was a cultural norm.

160
00:20:37,64 --> 00:20:41,93
But certainly not the Word of God and it's certainly not something we should be doing today but

161
00:20:42,06 --> 00:20:48,73
but if we go there then then what that really does is open up the entire Bible for that kind of I think very

162
00:20:48,74 --> 00:20:52,35
intelligent discourse where you you look at say this makes sense

163
00:20:53,02 --> 00:20:57,43
and this doesn't go according to the kinds of contouring that you talked about OK.

164
00:20:59,41 --> 00:21:07,75
The problem is trying to understand without the benefit of the teaching

165
00:21:07,76 --> 00:21:13,78
and the Holy Spirit without the Holy Spirit we're pretty well screwed.

166
00:21:15,28 --> 00:21:25,19
As far as that's concerned OK we have to we have to have the Holy Spirit we have to be baptized in the only spear in

167
00:21:25,2 --> 00:21:29,6
order to have the power and get the understanding from God.

168
00:21:31,66 --> 00:21:31,99
And

169
00:21:32,07 --> 00:21:38,86
and the understanding you can have through understanding just same time one human understanding one God the understanding

170
00:21:39,61 --> 00:21:39,98
OK.

171
00:21:41,66 --> 00:21:47,29
What do you mean by do you actually hope at some point to have some kind of reparation line between science

172
00:21:47,3 --> 00:21:52,7
and religion and I think that both sides have something to gain in the process

173
00:21:52,71 --> 00:21:59,98
and something very very difficult to lose for science it's giving up the physicalism and that's the part that I thing.

174
00:22:00,53 --> 00:22:03,54
The religious side really like this letting go of the physicalism.

175
00:22:04,76 --> 00:22:13,46
But then what science has is the advantage of the methodology of science which is never accept anything always question

176
00:22:13,47 --> 00:22:19,37
everything you can even if it Einstein said it is not the truth right it's it's it's an interesting idea to take verb

177
00:22:19,38 --> 00:22:25,66
or seriously to examine So there's a freedom from you at least in the ideal sense of freedom from dogmatism of course

178
00:22:25,67 --> 00:22:28,79
any individual scientist is dogmatic about their own theories

179
00:22:29,03 --> 00:22:35,15
but the science as a whole is not because the other scientists are very happy to tell you that you're wrong so as a as

180
00:22:35,16 --> 00:22:43,09
a discipline science as this non dogmatic aspect so that's what I think is really powerful about bringing the two

181
00:22:43,1 --> 00:22:52,74
together bringing the the non-dogmatic But you know more let's put these things out just as ideas that we can discuss

182
00:22:52,78 --> 00:22:55,69
and refine so that it's a dynamic process

183
00:22:56,31 --> 00:23:02,39
and that's so that's that's different from what most religious traditions have a right as it's mostly this is a

184
00:23:02,4 --> 00:23:08,88
scripture every word of it can't be questioned and so so I feel like from my point of view.

185
00:23:09,99 --> 00:23:11,86
The way I want to move forward is.

186
00:23:13,25 --> 00:23:18,31
To the point where I'm letting go of the physicalism which religion's like but I'm also letting go of the dogmatism

187
00:23:18,55 --> 00:23:21,95
and saying you know every like every verse in the Bible is something that I can look out

188
00:23:22,24 --> 00:23:28,84
and say this makes sense for this doesn't we should discuss it and and then move forward

189
00:23:28,88 --> 00:23:31,25
or not depending on what we what we see in it

190
00:23:32,05 --> 00:23:39,64
and if we have that kind of proper mud then I actually think we would have a evolving spirituality where we actually.

191
00:23:41,16 --> 00:23:49,32
Can move very very much more quickly forward in terms of understanding who we are as you beings that are not just space

192
00:23:49,33 --> 00:23:59,2
time bound beings something you know conscious I agree with you. And. The problem is that the universe.

193
00:24:00,01 --> 00:24:09,48
The universe as we know it is mathematical OK but. That's not all university is.

194
00:24:10,51 --> 00:24:16,61
Right that's not all there is there's the mathematical aspect there's the linguistic aspect

195
00:24:16,62 --> 00:24:25,3
and then there's the purpose of the whole thing right OK And that's one of the earth reasons why I like your model of

196
00:24:25,31 --> 00:24:35,00
conscious agents is because the pathway between experience and. Just decision.

197
00:24:38,24 --> 00:24:46,37
And then the pathway between decision and and the world actually the experience those.

198
00:24:47,41 --> 00:24:51,78
Are three different aspects and require three different.

199
00:24:53,51 --> 00:24:59,55
Markovian kernels right as you put it like OK From my perspective three different models.

200
00:25:01,35 --> 00:25:05,82
Because they're different functions in right and you cannot.

201
00:25:06,87 --> 00:25:12,49
You can get a third of it with mathematics right but only a third.

202
00:25:14,4 --> 00:25:21,63
Of the other third is a linguistics and then the third the cows most of all his purpose

203
00:25:22,12 --> 00:25:28,44
and the only way you can get purpose. Is to check with God.

204
00:25:29,5 --> 00:25:40,11
Because he's the one that's green it is all in and we've been created with a purpose for a purpose. And perception.

205
00:25:41,67 --> 00:25:50,42
Without purpose. Is meaningless perception with a purpose is meaningful. OK.

206
00:25:51,46 --> 00:25:59,98
And what is the purpose with what we're saying is the purpose that. Well the are our purpose is to know.

207
00:26:00,01 --> 00:26:13,13
God and enjoy him pervert. You know Joy is a very positive trait right. So enjoyment.

208
00:26:15,37 --> 00:26:21,66
And that's one place where my model hasn't gone which is the purpose side of things I'm still not there I'm thinking

209
00:26:22,00 --> 00:26:27,04
I've been thinking about that but from an evolutionary point of view which is you know.

210
00:26:28,08 --> 00:26:31,71
The standard I'm talking evolutionary psychology kind of point of view.

211
00:26:34,18 --> 00:26:38,91
And also just evolutionary biology more generally purpose comes down to.

212
00:26:41,06 --> 00:26:46,56
Taking actions that will allow you to survive long enough to reproduce.

213
00:26:48,29 --> 00:26:51,92
But and so then from that point of view all of our emotions

214
00:26:51,93 --> 00:26:57,19
and so forth have been shaped by evolution to guide us in ways that you know

215
00:26:57,2 --> 00:27:01,97
and to behave in ways that are adaptive so that we will survive long enough to reproduce

216
00:27:02,18 --> 00:27:06,84
and that's the notion of purpose within evolution ever evolution of evolutionary psychology

217
00:27:07,04 --> 00:27:14,5
but I myself don't feel comfortable that that's enough right because I feel like the evolution I mean I use

218
00:27:14,51 --> 00:27:16,86
evolutionary psychology I think it's really powerful framework

219
00:27:16,87 --> 00:27:24,98
and I actually think it will be very useful going forward for for therapy that that even with this inadequacies using

220
00:27:24,99 --> 00:27:33,11
evolutionary psychology to understand the roots of our emotions why we have anger why we are so angry at cheaters.

221
00:27:35,98 --> 00:27:38,19
Relationship between men and women and the different.

222
00:27:39,47 --> 00:27:41,63
Things that are going on there why men

223
00:27:41,64 --> 00:27:47,33
and women are so different a lot of that is understood by evolutionary psychology and can help if there be.

224
00:27:48,52 --> 00:27:51,9
And so I think the short term there will be an evolutionary.

225
00:27:53,28 --> 00:27:59,94
Psychotherapy coming out of evolutionary psychology that we really really insightful but but I still.

226
00:28:00,01 --> 00:28:03,08
Feel human beyond that will still need a deeper theory.

227
00:28:04,9 --> 00:28:11,29
But I see that happening over several decades and being a real win for for psychotherapy

228
00:28:11,3 --> 00:28:20,46
but then I want an even deeper understanding based because we don't yet I don't have a theory of evolution that it's

229
00:28:20,5 --> 00:28:24,46
based on conscious agents right so right now I'm just using the revolution as it's.

230
00:28:25,51 --> 00:28:32,53
In the physical stereo biological evolution I'm using that to show that the physicalist assumptions are false

231
00:28:33,16 --> 00:28:39,44
but what I have to do now and I haven't done it is so it's hard mathematical problem if an enormous is bad

232
00:28:39,45 --> 00:28:45,9
but at least it's a cause it's a it's a specific goal I've got which is to develop a mathematical model of the

233
00:28:45,91 --> 00:28:50,27
evolution of consciousness to understand what are the principal what is consciousness of all what's it about.

234
00:28:51,58 --> 00:28:58,22
Which then involves discussion of purpose you know so what is the reason for and why should conscious change at all

235
00:28:58,47 --> 00:29:00,94
but then to understand an evolution of consciousness

236
00:29:01,82 --> 00:29:06,69
and then take that evolution if I project it back whatever theory of evolution of consciousness I get

237
00:29:07,23 --> 00:29:13,98
but projected back into the space time interface of homo sapiens. Then actually get dark.

238
00:29:15,45 --> 00:29:21,17
Right then I should get back to standard Darwinian evolution if I do that so that would be a constraint that I would

239
00:29:21,3 --> 00:29:26,66
require on any theory of evolution of consciousness that a king with would be that that theory

240
00:29:26,87 --> 00:29:30,18
when I project it back into space time as we perceive it

241
00:29:31,1 --> 00:29:37,88
and matter would give us back standard Darwinian evolution which within that framework is quite well I think quite

242
00:29:37,89 --> 00:29:39,00
welcome confirmed

243
00:29:39,49 --> 00:29:46,17
but I don't yet have a theory of evolution of consciousness itself saw so I whereas in many other cases I can say you

244
00:29:46,18 --> 00:29:52,13
know I've not got the theorem to get the mathematics I can I can close the books on physicalism I can't close the books

245
00:29:52,14 --> 00:29:59,97
yet on a theory of purpose because I just haven't done that so so they're there I'm I don't have anything to offer back.

246
00:30:00,01 --> 00:30:04,11
Except to say that I don't have it and I'm very interested in pursuing it

247
00:30:04,12 --> 00:30:11,17
but I really I'm interested in pursuing it using a mathematical model as much as possible my feeling is that that

248
00:30:11,45 --> 00:30:12,27
eventually.

249
00:30:13,4 --> 00:30:21,69
Even spirituality can be in some sense an imperial enterprise where we actually have theories about consciousness Oh I

250
00:30:21,7 --> 00:30:25,05
agree and we could actually then go beyond that

251
00:30:25,06 --> 00:30:31,27
and that's why I think the you know having a different attitude toward the scriptures of all the religions not not just

252
00:30:31,28 --> 00:30:35,54
Christianity but an attitude of get inspiration were it makes sense

253
00:30:36,22 --> 00:30:39,81
and then take passages where they say women shouldn't talk

254
00:30:40,19 --> 00:30:45,69
and treat them as they should be treated as not to the Word of God for today that's definitely not what we should be

255
00:30:45,7 --> 00:30:45,98
doing

256
00:30:46,25 --> 00:30:52,65
and have that attitude towards the scriptures then I think we can actually have an evolutionary spirituality that were

257
00:30:52,66 --> 00:30:59,3
science and religion could actually meet and produce something that's really quite powerful the very human

258
00:30:59,31 --> 00:31:06,39
and yet very rigorous I will I'll thank you copying my model of your body to get far enough along what I know where I

259
00:31:06,4 --> 00:31:07,88
got the genes for Hanko models.

260
00:31:12,02 --> 00:31:23,03
So I agree with you and I recognize that So you know the problem about working on purpose is purpose is personal.

261
00:31:24,37 --> 00:31:31,65
Not mathematical Right OK So the purpose is outside the scope of mathematics.

262
00:31:32,68 --> 00:31:35,31
I mean you could have a purpose for mathematics.

263
00:31:36,83 --> 00:31:46,04
But purpose itself is outside the school it's too big an issue to be captured by mathematics OK.

264
00:31:47,44 --> 00:31:59,92
Linguistics is limited in that regard also OK Only God has purposed it out because he created us and.

265
00:32:00,54 --> 00:32:06,99
So therefore he's the one that can make everything work.

266
00:32:08,34 --> 00:32:14,87
You know and he has a purpose for our life whether we whether we seek that purpose

267
00:32:14,88 --> 00:32:24,9
or not is up to was he born transcripts are will OK but the purpose is there and their blessings that go with C.

268
00:32:24,91 --> 00:32:30,92
He Depor bas. I would agree that purpose is not itself mathematics.

269
00:32:32,02 --> 00:32:32,48
But I think

270
00:32:33,05 --> 00:32:38,75
but I would say also that you know my experience of the taste of chocolate is not mathematics Indeed I'm using

271
00:32:38,76 --> 00:32:41,82
mathematics to model conscious experiences and being.

272
00:32:42,97 --> 00:32:44,05
I think successful at it

273
00:32:44,06 --> 00:32:50,2
and I think eventually even though I agree that purpose itself is not mathematics if we understand.

274
00:32:51,26 --> 00:32:58,96
You get a deeper understanding of what purpose is then I can find mathematical correlates to to model that just like

275
00:32:59,00 --> 00:33:03,28
for example the space around us that you know is not mathematics

276
00:33:03,66 --> 00:33:12,78
but we can use Euclidean spaces you know our three to two model even though the mathematics isn't the space we can use

277
00:33:12,79 --> 00:33:18,99
to put in space and then we find out that that's not quite right if space really isn't Euclidean it's more Minkowsky

278
00:33:19,53 --> 00:33:24,77
and then we find out that's not right you know go from special to it to John relatively find out its remodelling

279
00:33:24,78 --> 00:33:25,32
and so forth

280
00:33:25,33 --> 00:33:30,71
and so what we do is we use the mathematics as a model of something that's not mathematics we know it's space is just

281
00:33:30,72 --> 00:33:33,29
space and as scientists

282
00:33:33,3 --> 00:33:40,18
and we use that to try to get at the deepest understanding we can with the help of the mathematics as a cognitive lever

283
00:33:40,19 --> 00:33:45,46
to help us go places you know conceptually that we might not be able to go without the mathematics

284
00:33:45,78 --> 00:33:49,17
and that's what I would hope with with purpose to have some deep intuitions

285
00:33:49,33 --> 00:33:52,61
and I'd be happy to get some from the Scriptures

286
00:33:52,62 --> 00:33:59,98
or over I can get them to get deeper into issues about purpose what it's about and then try to capture them in math.

287
00:34:00,01 --> 00:34:06,41
Batiks broad don't mistake the mathematics for the purpose it's mathematics is just a model in the same sense as if I

288
00:34:06,42 --> 00:34:09,26
have a simulation of the weather right a mathematical model of the weather

289
00:34:09,48 --> 00:34:15,24
and I come bring you into the computer room to show you my model you don't need an umbrella the simulation is not going

290
00:34:15,25 --> 00:34:17,95
to get you wet as it is just a simulation

291
00:34:17,96 --> 00:34:24,24
but it's nevertheless a very useful simulation of the other Nick actually be used care you know effectively to predict

292
00:34:24,5 --> 00:34:30,07
the future weather and so I don't mistake the mathematics itself for the purpose but I would love to get

293
00:34:30,63 --> 00:34:36,18
and this is again the I should have about all things that are taken as a spiritual where we take these concepts that

294
00:34:36,62 --> 00:34:38,88
for thousands of years have been only intuitive

295
00:34:39,64 --> 00:34:45,49
and we take those intuitions which I think you are a good starting point of fact all science starts with intuitions

296
00:34:45,75 --> 00:34:53,39
and then wrap as much mathematics as we can into it knowing full well that we're probably wrong the first time right

297
00:34:54,19 --> 00:34:58,13
space is not Euclidean it's not mentality it's probably not remodel it

298
00:34:58,36 --> 00:35:06,06
but every time we find out why we're wrong with our mathematics we learn and we in our own intuitions get multiply

299
00:35:06,07 --> 00:35:10,42
and so I'm hoping the same thing will happen ultimately in a more.

300
00:35:11,48 --> 00:35:18,38
Open almost scientific kind of spirituality where we're taking the concepts that have been viewed as completely you

301
00:35:18,39 --> 00:35:26,21
know off the off the table for mathematics put them on to the table start to develop strong mathematical models

302
00:35:26,53 --> 00:35:33,57
and try to make predictions even in terms of therapeutic contexts so if this is my mathematical model of purpose

303
00:35:33,96 --> 00:35:38,67
and this is a very human thing what does it tell me about interactions with people

304
00:35:38,68 --> 00:35:45,76
and psychotherapeutic And so ultimately this is a really scientific theory of this stuff where we don't mistake the

305
00:35:45,77 --> 00:35:48,42
mathematics for the purpose and the other aspects

306
00:35:48,43 --> 00:35:53,16
but we use it too as a cognitive lever we can actually bring science

307
00:35:53,17 --> 00:35:58,1
and religion together to really move things forward we can actually help people come be my wife

308
00:35:58,11 --> 00:35:59,98
and I hope there's a person for every done.

309
00:36:00,06 --> 00:36:13,69
That OK yeah that's Jesus Christ OK The he is the law he is the model for all of us for everything he is the truth OK

310
00:36:13,73 --> 00:36:21,15
so if we want to pursue truth then truth is a person it's not a thing OK.

311
00:36:22,29 --> 00:36:34,79
And so he came as a model but he came for a purpose and that was to provide a way for us who are natural sinners

312
00:36:34,8 --> 00:36:43,72
and who missed the mark. To have a way to. Be resolved or.

313
00:36:45,85 --> 00:36:53,59
Have our relationship with God the Father re stored Ridgeley And so that's why it's important to be a born again

314
00:36:53,6 --> 00:36:57,83
Christian there is only one way to get to God the Father.

315
00:36:59,47 --> 00:37:03,31
And that's through Jesus there is no other way period

316
00:37:04,31 --> 00:37:14,68
and it's a no I gree with you to take the man out this far as you know. But. But God goes further than that.

317
00:37:16,77 --> 00:37:19,25
You know why not go for the whole gusto.

318
00:37:20,34 --> 00:37:22,46
Right right well yeah

319
00:37:22,47 --> 00:37:28,27
and I certainly agree that there are probably in dodginess limits to it were a concept contiguous were.

320
00:37:29,39 --> 00:37:35,24
A species like any other species and we were finite we were expecting a boundary bright.

321
00:37:36,63 --> 00:37:41,87
Spiders can't learn physics and maybe we can't understand that you're pretty all right but with

322
00:37:41,88 --> 00:37:50,37
when we're born again as a christian those limitations don't last after we need this body.

323
00:37:52,04 --> 00:37:59,95
Blows those limitations are lifted. What I'm hoping for is though that. When we.

324
00:38:00,01 --> 00:38:08,73
Bring the mathematics to these issues that we can get to the place where we're making making mathematically precise

325
00:38:08,74 --> 00:38:16,28
predictions about. How we can grow as people. You've always people.

326
00:38:17,62 --> 00:38:19,41
Have better relationships and so forth

327
00:38:19,87 --> 00:38:25,89
and actually have a mathematically precise understanding of who we are as conscious beings

328
00:38:25,9 --> 00:38:31,91
and maybe hierarchies of conscious agents that will allow us to take our therapeutic and and.

329
00:38:33,24 --> 00:38:35,71
Social understanding to the to the next level

330
00:38:36,12 --> 00:38:43,67
but do so in a really rigorous fashion where we actually have ideas that we put out that we say I could be wrong about

331
00:38:43,68 --> 00:38:49,86
this so it's a very non-dogmatic attitude about this thing it's that saying you know even spirituality is an

332
00:38:49,87 --> 00:38:57,12
experimental science and we have our current ideas and our current ideas are the best we've got right now

333
00:38:57,65 --> 00:38:59,13
but there's a there's a D.P.

334
00:38:59,14 --> 00:39:04,64
Melody in the whole thing where we say you know what even the best that I understand right now I could be wrong on any

335
00:39:04,65 --> 00:39:14,19
point and then to then say so let's see we're we're might have be wrong on any things I'm saying. You.

336
00:39:15,25 --> 00:39:27,93
End up in presenting Jesus today there are three now three have acts that have to be fulfilled first to present Jesus

337
00:39:27,94 --> 00:39:35,19
today. There has to be love there has to be purity and there is to be power OK.

338
00:39:36,29 --> 00:39:44,13
Now you can if you can find a description of that the nine aspects of love in Galatians five twenty two

339
00:39:44,14 --> 00:39:46,21
and twenty three through this spirit.

340
00:39:47,62 --> 00:39:55,25
To the attitudes that lead to appear to be are described by nine be added in Matthew five.

341
00:39:58,05 --> 00:39:59,72
Check verses three to twelve.

342
00:40:01,31 --> 00:40:02,69
The gifts of the Holy Spirit

343
00:40:02,7 --> 00:40:08,9
and I guess totally spirit are described in First Corinthians twelve versus seven through a lot of it.

344
00:40:10,52 --> 00:40:16,91
Now if you if you take these and put them in the right sequence and and you make and make vectors out of them

345
00:40:17,71 --> 00:40:22,15
and in my case I've done it you take out you take out.

346
00:40:24,1 --> 00:40:27,98
The fruit you take is the attitude you take

347
00:40:27,99 --> 00:40:34,73
and you know if you put them together in the right sequence in the right way and you can represent.

348
00:40:35,8 --> 00:40:48,54
Christ appropriately OK now. When when Jesus was walking here he made it very clear to the ferrous.

349
00:40:49,7 --> 00:40:51,8
That they were whited simple curse.

350
00:40:53,00 --> 00:41:00,16
To it but they stood in the way of people getting their salvation they stood in the door

351
00:41:00,41 --> 00:41:02,6
and prevented people from getting through

352
00:41:03,25 --> 00:41:12,38
and he said he did he they were a generation of vipers OK And the reason he said that is because he said you know the

353
00:41:12,39 --> 00:41:22,67
law. You know the law. But you don't understand. The all that points to me.

354
00:41:24,99 --> 00:41:36,4
OK so you can be a legal listing and mathematics is very legalistic. Son bending it's on you. That's why.

355
00:41:37,46 --> 00:41:49,05
You you you you want to get. OK. But. That all of that perfection points to one man Jesus.

356
00:41:50,13 --> 00:41:58,04
Who is God Well the book that mathematics can be flexible right it's that it can be flexible and malleable

357
00:41:58,37 --> 00:41:59,98
but the I guess the attitude that I.

358
00:42:00,06 --> 00:42:08,56
Above of sort of an imperative all kind of spirituality where we're all working together to try to grow

359
00:42:08,57 --> 00:42:17,07
and understand and so forth. And and they pull out stones to kill him then he says why are you.

360
00:42:18,13 --> 00:42:25,18
Going to kill me and they say him because you being a mere man claim to be the Son of God and then Jesus says

361
00:42:25,81 --> 00:42:31,42
but haven't you read the Scriptures that say I have said all of you are gods

362
00:42:31,88 --> 00:42:35,32
and all of you are sons of the most high then Jesus goes on to say

363
00:42:35,67 --> 00:42:42,19
and if he says that there are gods to whom the word of God came and Jesus' prayer was

364
00:42:42,44 --> 00:42:43,73
and the Scripture cannot be broken.

365
00:42:44,83 --> 00:42:51,59
Then why are you trying to kill me just for claiming I'm the son of God so what Jesus is making very very clear there

366
00:42:52,09 --> 00:43:00,72
is that we're all gods. We're all sons of God but we're all gods and from that point of view we're all in a position.

367
00:43:02,25 --> 00:43:10,2
To discuss with each other and grow on an equal footing in other words so I'm

368
00:43:10,21 --> 00:43:12,43
but I'm suggesting that if you don't you take that one

369
00:43:12,44 --> 00:43:18,08
and take scriptures literally that Scripture is literally saying each one of us is God's

370
00:43:18,09 --> 00:43:21,75
and Jesus sort of emphasizes that point he says I have said you were God

371
00:43:21,79 --> 00:43:28,00
and the Scripture cannot be set set aside on this point he said Don't let the Scripture be set aside in this so we have

372
00:43:28,01 --> 00:43:30,23
to take that that point very very seriously

373
00:43:30,55 --> 00:43:37,54
and one place were were you going to take that very seriously as it says we're all of us done qualified as gods to

374
00:43:37,55 --> 00:43:43,89
explore what this whole thing is about and to go back and forth about it now in

375
00:43:44,65 --> 00:43:51,25
and saying that we're God's that's God with a little g. He's given us.

376
00:43:52,29 --> 00:43:59,98
Dominion over the earth not to have it he's given has to be you know these are OK That's why.

377
00:44:00,01 --> 00:44:03,85
He said in Genesis that's what he told Adam and Eve

378
00:44:03,89 --> 00:44:09,75
but that's Jesus argument right Jesus was saying to the pharmacy's I said that you were God I'm only claiming to be the

379
00:44:09,76 --> 00:44:14,26
Son of God so you shouldn't be killing me for being just a Son of God That's right they were claiming something bigger

380
00:44:14,41 --> 00:44:21,55
so Jesus point was not God with a little g I mean his whole argument was the opposite you guys are gods with a big G

381
00:44:21,59 --> 00:44:28,24
I'm just going to be the Son of God and so that was that was his argument to them when we're born again

382
00:44:28,49 --> 00:44:34,02
and were baptized in the Holy Spirit our spirit become one with the Holy Spirit.

383
00:44:35,43 --> 00:44:44,48
OK So from that perspective we are we've got everything that Jesus has. Our problem is.

384
00:44:45,24 --> 00:44:47,01
Most of us don't know what we hear.

385
00:44:48,17 --> 00:44:51,13
From Scripture we don't know the authority that we have

386
00:44:51,38 --> 00:45:03,46
and we don't know how to use it OK I gree with you that that there's a lot of growth at least take place in you know

387
00:45:03,52 --> 00:45:13,94
the majority of Christian all Christians gloating right all right. And scientists and anybody else Jesus.

388
00:45:15,12 --> 00:45:24,23
In terms of theology Jesus was perfect theology he's the model. OK. So.

389
00:45:25,27 --> 00:45:31,44
So where we were going to get our point of integration is around him personally.

390
00:45:32,96 --> 00:45:40,65
And if we in our church integrate ourselves psychologically around him and spiritually and physically around him.

391
00:45:41,67 --> 00:45:49,99
Then we're going to have as perfect. Operating life as we get to have OK and powerful.

392
00:45:55,98 --> 00:46:07,06
If you want to and I think this conversation no I'm happy. Listening OK. But we've had five yeah yeah.

393
00:46:08,08 --> 00:46:14,8
It's a good discussion. Now we've broken the ice on that while we can talk some more right.

394
00:46:16,44 --> 00:46:19,96
Now there are other issues that you guys think we might want to bring up

395
00:46:19,97 --> 00:46:24,66
or if you think as a scientist try to get more you know I'm happy to look at the modeling

396
00:46:24,7 --> 00:46:32,36
and get as much intuition just I can there might my feeling about this is that. If we take this more.

397
00:46:33,43 --> 00:46:39,27
Open attitude long dogmatic where we just it's a free for all everybody has the freedom to put their ideas out there

398
00:46:39,63 --> 00:46:47,57
for them that we could really push things forward very very quickly I deserve it I believe that what you've done in

399
00:46:47,58 --> 00:46:59,04
terms of giving he ontology the turned around bowing in the same direction as spirituality OK now you can now harmony

400
00:46:59,05 --> 00:47:05,92
can take place I think I think it really can the only thing is used I mean I greet the intelligence.

401
00:47:07,07 --> 00:47:12,05
Is remarkably amenable to most religious points you know it's remarkable that it comes out that way.

402
00:47:13,45 --> 00:47:18,45
And it's against physical so many of my scientific colleagues are are stunned but then they finally understand

403
00:47:18,46 --> 00:47:25,96
and they go yeah you got me that physicalism doesn't seem to be right so the next step is just letting go of dogmatism

404
00:47:25,97 --> 00:47:27,13
My feeling is that.

405
00:47:29,39 --> 00:47:38,52
Claims of infallibility have always gone bad in human history right it's it leads to wars between religions it leads to

406
00:47:38,76 --> 00:47:45,13
strife and so forth an attitude of humility that says you know what here's my current point of view

407
00:47:45,41 --> 00:47:49,56
but I could be wrong let's have a discussion and let's find out where a got things wrong and we're

408
00:47:49,57 --> 00:47:55,67
and we're having that kind of dialogue from one of humility that's where we can really make progress verb

409
00:47:55,68 --> 00:47:59,98
or it quickly and so when I put out about a mathematical model of brick.

410
00:48:00,17 --> 00:48:04,41
Careful when I do that in like a public setting to say I'm putting this out.

411
00:48:05,85 --> 00:48:10,12
To be precise so we can find out precisely why I'm wrong

412
00:48:10,81 --> 00:48:16,45
and that's the attitude I love to see happening in spirituality words instead of saying you know it's my way

413
00:48:16,46 --> 00:48:23,17
or the highway it's rather here here is I think a beautiful idea but let's explore and see where I might be wrong

414
00:48:23,42 --> 00:48:28,27
and with that out of to have it I think we have the best chance of really moving forward

415
00:48:28,54 --> 00:48:33,62
and having a spirit that doesn't lead to you know the fighting or you're you know if you

416
00:48:33,72 --> 00:48:40,68
and that's one of the reasons that I really enjoy Andrew Weil Mack and Bill Johnson

417
00:48:41,59 --> 00:48:43,56
and you will make them to Colorado

418
00:48:43,57 --> 00:48:51,69
and Bill Johnson up in Redding California because they have that kind of open spirit I think OK and.

419
00:48:53,28 --> 00:48:59,36
You know what I have or I've observed is that there are there that a Christian so.

420
00:49:01,01 --> 00:49:09,02
One of the conclusions of your father was that when you're looking for a model there is a model he's right right.

421
00:49:10,04 --> 00:49:16,64
Well and I think that I can look to Jesus' life for insight and guidance

422
00:49:16,65 --> 00:49:20,72
but as a scientist I'm a Benchley going to look at it with a critical eye

423
00:49:21,5 --> 00:49:27,28
and maybe there are parts of it that I don't think are good or a great model and to to pick

424
00:49:27,29 --> 00:49:36,19
and choose for myself what I think is is worth and it what's inspiring and what what is not. So so.

425
00:49:37,94 --> 00:49:44,8
Find my inspiration there and other places as well so our attitudes are a little bit different on that point. And.

426
00:49:46,54 --> 00:49:49,04
Everything you do you're going by God.

427
00:49:50,53 --> 00:49:55,9
To think about what he's saying there part of the problem is that I don't have my own mathematical understanding of

428
00:49:55,91 --> 00:49:59,98
what God might be if I can at all so for me as a scientist.

429
00:50:00,01 --> 00:50:07,59
Until I can unpack what in the three o'clock to say just what correspond to there it's hard for me to to grapple with

430
00:50:07,6 --> 00:50:16,16
the with with the problem I mean one thing that seems to come out of my theory is that no consciousness is omniscient.

431
00:50:17,54 --> 00:50:25,37
And that would seem to be against what most ideas about God say so if if that's the case

432
00:50:25,38 --> 00:50:28,77
and again not that that's just my current understanding of a model even there I could be wrong

433
00:50:28,96 --> 00:50:34,08
but right now my understanding my model is that that no conscious agent could be omniscient

434
00:50:34,13 --> 00:50:42,12
and even in the sense of completely self understanding so the idea that you are guided by God Well if I'm not I

435
00:50:42,13 --> 00:50:47,17
certainly would allow myself to try to unpack that statement in a rigorous mathematical way at some point

436
00:50:47,18 --> 00:50:51,76
and to unpack that. As well to write.

437
00:50:53,57 --> 00:50:57,79
Well that if he is right then I'll get some kind of mathematical understanding of what what.

438
00:50:59,1 --> 00:51:03,46
A rigorous understanding of God means and if that's possible

439
00:51:03,93 --> 00:51:10,39
and then an interpretation of what he's saying that would make sense to me what I don't want is a hand wave instead of

440
00:51:10,4 --> 00:51:17,34
understanding that's that's what I mean these can sometimes be statements that you just hear

441
00:51:17,35 --> 00:51:21,38
and repeat that have been heard and repeated for many many centuries

442
00:51:21,89 --> 00:51:26,35
and I would like to go beyond just repeating what people have said for thousands of years I would like to actually get

443
00:51:26,93 --> 00:51:31,38
testable hypotheses that make predictions that I that are surprising to me

444
00:51:32,05 --> 00:51:37,14
and to start to make progress because the the kind of thing where you say Jesus is the model is something you could

445
00:51:37,15 --> 00:51:43,97
have said you know eight hundred years ago in the same way I would like to start to say something new in a rigorously

446
00:51:43,98 --> 00:51:49,97
mathematical way so I mean ultimately who knows where it will lead me I don't know it maybe could lead to reject

447
00:51:49,98 --> 00:51:57,31
everything you say or maybe it will lead me to to say this you know I understand you in this particular fashion

448
00:51:57,71 --> 00:51:59,98
but that may be it not be the fashion in which you understood.

449
00:52:00,01 --> 00:52:04,01
So so we'll see where we're the mathematics leads it's an open enterprise.

450
00:52:05,26 --> 00:52:12,9
You happy yeah yeah I'm happy with a good look at the tenor of the conversation I was glad that that he was they were

451
00:52:12,91 --> 00:52:20,13
not. Defensive. I expected them to be more defensive about it specially when I was talking about.

452
00:52:21,41 --> 00:52:29,1
Not taking every word of the Bible as you know infallible word of God I mean for me that's absolutely essential to to

453
00:52:29,14 --> 00:52:35,65
secure that point because if you take it as the infallible word of God there's no chance for progress I mean if it's

454
00:52:35,66 --> 00:52:42,12
all set in stone how can we how can we grow up so I was delighted that they seem to let go of that point although I had

455
00:52:42,13 --> 00:52:51,18
to hit them with a pretty hard example to to make that happen. Looking at them.

456
00:52:55,95 --> 00:52:59,81
In the other question or no OK my question OK.
